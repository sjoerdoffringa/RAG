Icom has said it halted production a decade ago of the radio models identified in the attack, and that most of those still on sale were counterfeit.\n\nYoshiki Enomoto, the general manager of Icom's security and trade division, told Reuters it was possible that an older Icom device had been modified to make a bomb.\n\nIt would be difficult to insert an explosive device into the main compartment of the walkie-talkie because its electronics are tightly packed, so it was more likely to have been in the detachable battery pack, Enomoto told the Japanese broadcaster Fuji TV.\n\nThe Lebanese source said explosions had occurred even in cases where the battery pack was separated from the rest of the device.\n\nA Lebanese security source had earlier told Reuters that the pagers had been implanted with explosives that were difficult to detect. Another security source told Reuters that up to three grams (0.11 ounce) of explosives had been hidden in the new pagers, apparently months before the blasts.\n\n(Reporting by Maya Gebeily; Additional reporting by Tim Kelly in Tokyo; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle and Kevin Liffey)",

According to the 2024 North American Airport Satisfaction Survey from JD Power, Orange County’s John Wayne Airport is the best large airport in North America. The “large airport” category includes airports that receive between 10 and 32.9 million passengers per year. Orange County’s lone commercial airport beat out competitors like Tampa International Airport (No. 2), Kansas City International Airport (No. 3), Dallas Love Field (No. 4) and Nashville International Airport (No. 5). Other California airports ranked in that category include Sacramento International Airport (No. 7), San Jose International Airport (No. 10), Oakland International Airport (No. 19) and San Diego International Airport (No. 21). Other California airports earned high placements in other categories. In the “mega airport” category, for airports that receive 33 million or more passengers per year, Los Angeles International Airport ranked No. 13. Topping that category was Minnesota’s Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport. Rounding out the top five included Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (No. 2), Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (No. 3), John F.

Even the local National Weather Service office for New Orleans chimed in on their thoughts when forecasting for the week ahead. This was stated in their latest area forecast discussion released on Friday morning…\n\n“Models are having an absolute melt down on how to handle the area that the\n\nhurricane center has wrapped in 40% for development”. The National Hurricane Center is still highlighting the northern Caribbean as an area of potential development for next week.

As for location of landfall, time that it spends in the Gulf, and intensity of the storm… we simply just do not have enough information about the storm yet to give that information responsibly to the public. Forecast models have had this storm making landfall from Mexico to the Florida Peninsula. Imagine telling ALL off those residents that there’s a chance for a major hurricane heading straight for them. Not only would that be incorrect, but it would also irresponsibly place fear onto communities that may be very sensitive to the topic of hurricanes at the moment given the fact that they are still recovering from past storms.

Every year since, on the 26th of each month, Clemente Rodríguez, his wife, Luz María Telumbre, and other families meet at the Rural Normal School at Ayotzinapa and take a long bus ride to the capital, Mexico City, to demand answers.

The lawsuit filed Wednesday morning alleges the teenager’s death would have been prevented if additional safety measures had been taken. While walking to school in January, the Barrington High School student was struck and killed by an oncoming train at the Hough Street Crossing, located near Hough and Main Streets. The teen's family alleges that safety equipment—including pedestrian gates installed at other Barrington railroad crossings—could have saved her life. \"She left her home that morning, said goodbye to her family and she was on her way,\" said Jim Pullos, partner at Clifford Law Offices. As a high school junior, it was a walk Lacson had taken hundreds of times, but when she left home on the morning of January 25, 2024, there was no way to know it would be her last. \"The tragedy here is this was entirely preventable,\" said Pullos. \"[The family] wants to make a difference. They want to prevent anything like this from ever happening again.\" Around 7:45 a.m. on the morning of her death, the family’s attorney said Lacson waited at the Hough Street Crossing for a train to pass. While there are gates to block vehicular traffic, there are none in the pedestrian walkway. With dense fog in the area, Pullos said Lacson didn’t realize another train was approaching from the opposite direction. \"There was incredibly dense fog.",

(Sheila and Fred McCoy via AP)\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Days after a shooter attacked an interstate and disappeared, leaving a Kentucky community scared and on guard, Fred and Sheila McCoy decided to lace up their boots for the first time in a long time and spend days in rugged terrain searching until, finally, they found a body. Kentucky State Police credited Fred and Sheila McCoy, who typically spend their retired days creating YouTube videos about the Hatfield-McCoy feud, with helping investigators find what they believe are the remains of Joseph Couch. Couch, 32, is suspected of firing randomly at vehicles on Interstate 75 on Sept. 7, wounding five people. The person believed to be Couch died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, said Kentucky’s Chief Medical Examiner, Dr. William Ralston. A soft tissue DNA test was inconclusive on the identification of the body, and testing on the bones could take up to two days, Ralston said. A toxicology test is also pending. Teams of local, state and federal law enforcement had searched tens of thousands of acres of woods since the shooting. Authorities warned residents to be extra vigilant and some schools temporarily shifted to virtual learning. “For one week we turned into bounty hunters,” Fred McCoy told The Associated Press on Thursday.",

Pandas are native to China and an international symbol of the country. Chow Chows were painted to resemble pandas at a Chinese zoo (TikTok)\n\nIn one visitor’s video, one of the “pandas” was visibly panting while resting on a rock in a fence, while another clip had a panda with a long tail strolling about. “It’s a PANdog,” one viewer wrote, while someone else joked: “That’s the Temu version of a panda.”\n\n“They were panting that’s why they are pandas,” a third noted. After visitors publicized the ruse on social media, the organizers admitted they’d painted two Chow Chows — a fluffy dog breed originally from northern China — with black-and-white panda markings. Since then, visitors have demanded their money back for false advertising. This isn’t the first time a Chinese zoo has misled visitors with claims of housing real pandas. In May, NBC Newsreported that Taizhou Zoo in Jiangsu Province had also painted Chow Chows. Zoo representatives initially claimed that the animals were a rare breed of “panda dogs,” before admitting that such animals don’t exist. At the time, zoo officials told Chinese state media they had advertised them as “panda dogs,” and did not intentionally mislead anyone.",

The resignations follow drawn-out negotiations with 23andMe CEO and co-founder Anne Wojcicki, who wants to take the company private. In a Tuesday letter addressed to Wojcicki, the seven directors said they had yet to receive a “a fully financed, fully diligenced, actionable proposal that is in the best interests of the non-affiliated shareholders” from the chief executive after months of efforts. The directors said they would be resigning effective immediately — arguing that, while they still believed in 23andMe's mission, their departures were for the best due to Wojcicki’s concentrated voting power and a “clear” difference of opinion on the company's future. Wojcicki later responded to the resignations in a memo to employees, published in a securities filing, saying she was “surprised and disappointed” by the directors' decision. Still, she maintained that taking 23andMe private and “outside of the short term pressures of the public markets” would be best for the company long term. Wojcicki added that 23andMe would immediately be identifying independent directors to join the board. Wojcicki, who holds 49% of the voting power at 23andMe, was the only remaining board member listed on the company's website as of Thursday. A spokesperson had no further updates to share when reached by The Associated Press. 23andMe, which went public in 2021, has struggled to find a profitable business model since. The company reported a net loss of $667 million for its last fiscal year, more than double the loss of $312 million for the year prior.",

This is the second berry heist in the last week in Gulf Shores. A call about a reckless driver resulted in what looked like a clown car opening up with 30 bags of the berries confiscated and more than half of dozen people escaping into the night. “I have absolutely never seen anything like this before,” added Wittstruck. The berry is used in dietary supplements to treat everything from urinary symptoms to hair loss. It is illegal to harvest them in Florida without a permit. They can sell for up to 10 dollars a pound. It is illegal for multiple reasons, including the impact on wildlife and the rate it takes for the berry to grow. “I thought it was actual drugs in bags.” For Kayla Stull, this vacation has been quite an adventure.",

What they found spells potential disaster for the planet\n\nScientists using ice-breaking ships and underwater robots have found the Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica is melting at an accelerating rate and could be on an irreversible path to collapse, spelling catastrophe for global sea level rise. Since 2018, a team of scientists forming the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, has been studying Thwaites — often dubbed the “Doomsday Glacier” — up close to better understand how and when it might collapse. Their findings, set out across a collection of studies, provide the clearest picture yet of this complex, ever-changing glacier. The outlook is “grim,” the scientists said in a report published Thursday, revealing the key conclusions of their six years of research. They found rapid ice loss is set to speed up this century. Thwaites’ retreat has accelerated considerably over the past 30 years, said Rob Larter, a marine geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey and part of the ITGC team. “Our findings indicate it is set to retreat further and faster,” he said. The scientists project Thwaites and the Antarctic Ice Sheet could collapse within 200 years, which would have devastating consequences. Thwaites holds enough water to increase sea levels by more than 2 feet. But because it also acts like a cork, holding back the vast Antarctic ice sheet, its collapse could ultimately lead to around 10 feet of sea level rise, devastating coastal communities from Miami and London to Bangladesh and the Pacific Islands.

The crimes “took place under IS rule in Raqqa, and this is the first time that IS attacks against the Yazidi minority have been tried in Sweden,” senior prosecutor Reena Devgun said in a statement. The Yazidis are one of Iraq’s oldest religious minorities. “Women, children and men were regarded as property and subjected to being traded as slaves, sexual slavery, forced labor, deprivation of liberty and extrajudicial executions,” Devgun said. “IS tried to annihilate the Yazidi ethnic group on an industrial scale.\" In announcing the charges, Devgun told a news conference that the prosecutors were able to identify Ishaq through information from the U.N. team investigating atrocities in Iraq, known as UNITAD. In a separate statement, the Stockholm District Court said the prosecution claims she detained a number of women and children of the Yazidi ethnic group in her residence in Raqqa, and “allegedly exposed them to, among other things, severe suffering, torture or other inhumane treatment\" and also deprived \"them of fundamental rights for cultural, religious and gender reasons contrary to general international law.”\n\nAccording to the charge sheet, obtained by The Associated Press, Ishaq is suspected of holding nine people, including children, in her Raqqa home for up to seven months and treating them as slaves.",

While supply chains and distribution channels for higher-margin and newer products are tightly managed, that's not the case for older electronics from Asia where counterfeiting, surplus inventories and complex contract manufacturing deals can sometimes make it impossible to identify the source of a product, analysts and consultants say. The response from the companies at the centre of the booby-trapped gadgets that killed 37 people and wounded about 3,000 in Lebanon this week has underlined difficulties in discerning how and when they were weaponised. Taiwan-based Gold Apollo put the blame on a Europe-based licensee of its pager, sparking investigations in Hungary, Bulgaria, Norway and Romania into the origins of the deadly device.

But the actual supply chain compromise is not that hard. Probably the easiest part was the supply chain compromise,\" said David Fincher, a China-based technologist and consultant. He said counterfeit products are prevalent, especially in big manufacturing centres like China where fake components can be easily produced, adding that it isn't a big leap to go from fake components to supply chain compromise. \"As the technologist I am, I can tell you getting a little explosive in a radio is not that hard.\"",

Credit: Getty Images\n\nResearchers have finally identified the source of mysterious noises coming from the deepest ocean trench. The odd sounds, described as \"biotwang\" noises, sound a bit like sci-fi starships, and are actually whale calls from Bryde's whales (Balaenoptera edeni). The whales may use the calls to locate one another like a giant game of Marco Polo, researchers say. Scientists first detected the unusual noises in 2014 while using underwater gliders to carry out an acoustic survey of the Mariana Trench — the world's deepest ocean trench, which spans more than 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers) south of Japan and has a maximum depth of 35,876 feet (10,935 meters) . The biotwang sound can be broken down into two distinct parts: first, a low, grumbly sound that reverberates through the deep; and second, a high-pitched, metallic ringing that researchers have likened to the sounds made by spaceships in Star Trek and Star Wars. The sounds initially stumped scientists. But in 2016, researchers revealed that biotwang was most likely a call from large baleen whales , such as blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) or humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). However, the sounds did not match any known whale calls. In the new study, published Wednesday (Sept. 18) in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science , researchers were finally able to prove that Bryde's whales were making the noises, thanks in part to new artificial intelligence (AI) tools that sifted through over 200,000 hours of audio recordings containing various ocean sounds.",

Credit: Felix Schöfbänker\n\nIn the hush-hush, secretive world of space-based spy satellites, few details are publicly available — and groups like the U.S. Space Force, National Reconnaissance Office, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency like it that way. There's an armada of classified spacecraft assigned an array of vigilant duties. Some intercept radio waves or detect missile launches. Others yield close-up looks at select areas using sharp-eyed optical systems or scan Earth with powerful radar technology. These high-flying satellites are tempting targets for amateur astrophotographers. Such is the case for space watcher veteran Felix Schöfbänker in Upper Austria. \"My images have certainly revealed a few things that either were not known, or only were speculated before,\" Schöfbänker tells Space.com. In the past few months Schöfbänker has caught some classified spy satellites with his 14\" Dobsonian telescope, optimized for satellite tracking and imaging from his home. Poring over imagery, he is sharing his results and what those images suggest. Coming into focus for Schöfbänker, for example, has been a new generation of optical and radar imaging U.S. reconnaissance satellites, hurled into space for the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), which designs, launches and operates spy satellites on behalf of the U.S. federal government.

        "text": "Chefs often consider tenderloin or filet mignon to be overrated cuts of steak, but Gordon Ramsay disagrees. The filet, or filet mignon, is one of his \"favorite cuts of all time\" because it is \"packed with flavor\" (per YouTube). Due to its leanness, it's a cut that can easily overcook and become dry, which is why it's one of the worst cuts of steak to grill. But Ramsay uses an unexpected ingredient to keep it juicy: chicken stock. First, the chef sears both sides of his meat in a skillet — laying the meat away from you rather than towards you is Ramsay's tip for not burning yourself when making steak. Then he adds garlic, rosemary, thyme, and a bay leaf before pouring in the stock. Adding the extra liquid means more moist meat since some of it is absorbed by the steak as it cooks and rests. As the stock cooks down and absorbs the flavors from the aromatics, it also becomes an easy pan sauce to accompany the filet. Chicken stock works well because it has a delicate taste that won't overpower a less robustly flavored cut such as filet mignon. Ramsay likes to make his own stock, which he describes as \"the vital ingredient to good cooking\" (via Facebook). But you could use store-bought if it's easier, or try different flavors for other cuts. A richer beef stock might suit an intensely savory sirloin, for example.

There have been no confirmed sightings since. For a better understanding of the whereabouts of the alligator, wildlife pundit Jim Moulton, who goes by the name Bwana Jim, offers his expertise on alligators. Moulton, from the Rochester, New York area, has made Erie appearances at reptile expos and with his traveling wildlife shows. He has more than 25 years of experience handling animals ranging from armadillos to exotic birds and alligators. Moulton believes this alligator was someone's pet let loose into the wild. \"It was definitely someone’s pet and it was a foolish thing to do,” Moulton said. “It’s not the first time that people have been placing gators in ponds or lakes. They escape, they are good escape artists.”\n\nFrom his experience at wildlife expos, Moulton sees alligators being sold as babies under a foot in length. When the animals grow into a reptile over six feet in length, they become hard to tame as pets. That is when Moulton says they likely could get released into the wild. Is the Lake Erie alligator alive? Sighting reported during fourth week of search\n\nFollowing the right tracks\n\nIn this file photo, alligator tracks are shown on the beach along the Gulf of Mexico side of St. Vincent Island. The paw prints were about 15-inches long, 18 inches with claws included. There are a variety of animal tracks visible at Presque Isle, and there is a possibility some may be from the alligator.",

Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters that Moscow was concerned by what she called increasingly \"provocative\" activity on the border with Belarus, saying she did not rule out that there could be attempts to escalate in the region. Days after Ukraine's surprise Aug. 6 incursion into Russia's Kursk region, Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko - a loyal ally of President Vladimir Putin - suggested, without providing evidence, that Kyiv may have ideas about attacking Belarus. Minsk, which has accused Ukrainian drones of violating its airspace, later announced it was sending extra troops to its border with Ukraine, though Kyiv said it had seen no major changes in the border area. \"We take due note of the information received about the intensification of the activities of Ukrainian forces in the border zone,\" said Zakharova. \"We see these facts ourselves and are aware of constant attempts from the Ukrainian side to use drones and to send terrorists into the republic,\" she added. Ukraine's foreign ministry said last month that the country \"has never taken and is not going to take any unfriendly actions against the Belarusian people\". In a clear reference to Ukraine's Kursk incursion, Zakharova said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had shown he was capable of what she called \"reckless steps\", accusing him of coordinating his action with Washington ahead of a November U.S. presidential election.",

Two weeks earlier she had taken part in the murder of Bian Zhongyun, deputy principal of the Beijing high school she attended, one of the first – and one of the most notorious – of the murders that inaugurated a decade of slaughter in which between one and two million people were killed. In 2014, however, Song’s public apology for her involvement in the murder – one of the most high-profile expressions of contrition by a former Red Guard – provoked a mixture of scorn and calls for a national reckoning for the suffering and carnage of 1966-76. In 2013 China’s leader President Xi Jinping had issued a directive banning discussions of “the party’s past mistakes”, and after news of Song Binbin’s apology spread on the internet, the Chinese State Internet Information Office issued a further directive. “Due to the complicated public opinion situation on the Internet,” it read, “all websites are to cool down on their reporting of Song Binbin’s apology. All such reports have to be removed from the front page, while all interactive groups have to stop their discussion [of it].”\n\nMao’s ‘Little Red Book’ containing quotations from his writings and speeches\n\nSong had been a student leader of the revolutionary Red Guards at the Girls’ Middle School, attended by the children of the party elite, in 1966 when Mao, in an attempt to regain the initiative after years of failed policies by purging the Communist Party of ‘‘capitalists’’ and “class enemies”, lit the spark for a decade of chaos by urging young people to rise up against their parents and teachers.",

(AP Photo/Denes Erdos)\n\nROME (AP) — The woman whose company was linked to thousands of pagers that exploded in Lebanon and Syria this week is under the protection of the Hungarian secret services, her mother told The Associated Press on Friday. Cristiana Bársony-Arcidiacono has not appeared publicly since the deadly simultaneous attack that targeted Hezbollah on Tuesday and that has been widely blamed on Israel. She is listed as the CEO of Budapest-based BAC Consulting, which the Taiwanese trademark holder of the pagers said was responsible for the manufacture of the devices. Her mother, Beatrix Bársony-Arcidiacono, told the AP that her daughter had received unspecified threats and “is currently in a safe place protected by the Hungarian secret services.\" The “Hungarian secret services advised her not to talk to media,” she said by phone from Sicily. Hungary's national security authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and the AP could not independently verify the claim. Two days of attacks this week, first targeting pagers and then walkie-talkies, have killed at least 37 people and wounded more than 3,000, including civilians. Hezbollah and the Lebanese government have blamed Israel, which has neither confirmed nor denied involvement. Cristiana Bársony-Arcidiacono's company came under scrutiny after Gold Apollo, a Taiwanese firm, said it had authorized BAC Consulting to use its name on the pagers that were used in the first attack, but that the Hungarian company was responsible for manufacturing and design.",

Instead of settling for high down payments and rising mortgage rates stateside, Russell made an unexpected choice: he bought a 2.5-acre off-grid island in Finland for just $31,000. But, given that Russell is half-Finnish and he spent his childhood summers there, Russell’s choice wasn’t completely unorthodox. Don't miss\n\n“It was less than a home deposit,” Russell recently told the New York Post, emphasizing the affordability of his unconventional purchase. Initially browsing real estate sites for fun, Russell stumbled upon the island, and now he and his girlfriend are embracing the off-grid lifestyle. Their project began with a tent and an outhouse, with ambitious long-term plans for a log cabin and sauna. With U.S. median down payments hitting $64,000 in June and mortgage rates hovering around 6.6%, Russell’s investment strategy offers a refreshing take on how to enter the real estate market without breaking the bank. Cheaper real estate\n\nAfter spending most of his life in Laguna Beach, California, an area known for its expensive real estate, Russell moved to Fort Collins, Colorado, in 2020. However, when plans to secure affordable tuition for school fell through, Russell made an unexpected pivot, moving to Helsinki, Finland, where he found a creative solution to dodging the rising costs of the U.S. housing market.",

(Kaitlin Newman/The Baltimore Banner via AP, File)\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) — It was just another overnight shift for Damon Davis, a road construction inspector who was supervising repairs on Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge — until the deck beneath his feet started crumbling. He ran for his life and, miraculously, made it to safety moments before the bridge collapsed into the water below. “You can visualize, as he is coming forward, the bridge is collapsing behind him,” said Baltimore attorney Billy Murphy, whose firm is representing Davis in a liability case against the owner and manager of the Dali, the massive container ship that veered off course and crashed into one of the bridge’s supporting columns in March. The attorneys held a news conference Thursday to announce their upcoming claim. Six members of the road crew whose work Davis was inspecting that night died in the collapse and another narrowly survived falling from the bridge. Their job that night was filling potholes on the bridge deck. A last-minute mayday call from the ship’s pilot allowed police officers to stop traffic to the bridge, but they didn’t have time to alert the road crew. The workers were on break when disaster struck. Most were sitting in their construction vehicles and had no warning about the impending collapse. The man who survived the fall, Julio Cervantes Suarez, was able to manually roll down the window of his rapidly sinking truck and climb out into the frigid water of the Patapsco River, where he clung to a piece of floating debris until he was rescued by first responders.",

Shares of Trump Media, commonly called TMTG, tumbled almost 7% to $13.73, putting the value of the company at less than $3 billion. Trump owns more than half of it. Trump and other insiders in the company have been unable to cash in on the highly volatile stock due standard lock-up agreements that prevent big stakeholders from selling stakes for a set period after a company becomes publicly traded. TMTG began trading publicly in March. Trump owns nearly 115 million shares of the company, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Based on TMTG's share price early Friday, Trump's holdings are worth, at least on paper, about $1.6 billion. It's usually not in the best interest of big stakeholders to even attempt to sell large tranches of their stock because it could risk a broader sell-off. Since going public, shares in Trump Media have gyrated wildly, often depending on news related to Trump, the Republican presidential nominee. One week ago, the company's shares jumped nearly 12% after Trump said he wouldn't sell shares when the lock-up period lifted.

The outcry comes over a $5 million settlement of a football hazing lawsuit where property owners in Kingfisher school district are mad that they’re being told their taxes will go up for three years to pay $3.75 million of the settlement. Estimates came in that the increase could be as much as 12%. Kingfisher wasn’t insured, so much of the cost ended up being pushed towards taxpayers. “Knowing what happened in Kingfisher and now hearing the settlement last night here, I know that we’re not flush with millions of dollars of cash,” said Robert Helms, who moved to Ninnekah four years ago.",

        "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) -A close ally of President Vladimir Putin warned Western governments on Thursday that a nuclear war would ensue if they gave the green light for Ukraine to use long-range Western weapons to strike targets deep inside Russia. Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the lower house of parliament and a member of Putin's Security Council, was responding to a vote in the European Parliament urging EU countries to give such approval to Kyiv. \"What the European Parliament is calling for leads to a world war using nuclear weapons,\" Volodin wrote on Telegram. His message was entitled \"For those who didn't get it the first time\" - an apparent reference to a warning by Putin last week that the West would be directly fighting Russia if it let Ukraine fire the long-range missiles onto Russian territory. The Ukraine war has triggered the biggest confrontation between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, which is considered to be the time when the two Cold War superpowers came closest to intentional nuclear war. The outgoing head of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, told The Times this week that the Kremlin leader had declared \"many red lines\" before but not escalated conflict with the West when they were crossed. Putin's spokesman said his comment was dangerous and provocative. In a non-binding resolution adopted on Thursday, the European Parliament asked EU countries to \"immediately lift restrictions on the use of Western weapons systems delivered to Ukraine against legitimate military targets on Russian territory.\" Volodin wrote: \"If something like this happens, Russia will give a tough response using more powerful weapons. No one should have any illusions about this.\"",

I can see it coming,” said Robert Baer, a former CIA case officer. He said the recent explosions of pagers and VHF radios being used by Hezbollah operatives in Lebanon is a logical prelude to an invasion.\n\n“Netanyahu has promised that he’s going to go in, and I think it’s going to be a ground invasion. And it’s going to be very destructive, just as destructive as it was in Gaza,” Baer told NewsNation’s “CUOMO” on Wednesday.\n\nRegarding the collateral damage from the booby-trapped pagers and radios that exploded this week, Baer said the alternative would have been trying to destroy Hezbollah communications with bombs, which would have produced far more civilian casualties.\n\nBlinken says US did not know about exploding pagers in Lebanon, calls for restraint\n\nBut when it comes to worrying about collateral damage, “after 7 October, all rules are gone,” Baer said. “It was such a shock to Israel. The gloves are off.”\n\nAnswering Chris Cuomo’s question of whether it is wrong for Israel to set off explosives that were carried by people in public places including markets and buses, Baer was blunt.\n\n“Everything that goes on in the Middle East is wrong. International law is gone.”\n\nBaer also fears that a greater conflict will “cascade” and could spread violence to Iran, the Persian Gulf, “and who knows where it goes from there.”\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

(AP) — Residents of a tiny Appalachian town struggled Friday to cope with a shooting involving two of its most prominent citizens: a judge who was gunned down in his courthouse chambers and a local sheriff charged with his murder. “It’s just so sad. I just hate it,” said Mike Watts, the Letcher County circuit court clerk. “Both of them are friends of mine. I’ve worked with both of them for years.”\n\nThe preliminary investigation indicates Letcher County Sheriff Shawn “Mickey” Stines shot District Judge Kevin Mullins multiple times following an argument inside the courthouse, according to Kentucky State Police. Mullins, 54, who held the judgeship for 15 years, died at the scene, and Stines, 43, surrendered without incident. He was charged with one count of first-degree murder. The fatal shooting stunned the tight-knit town of Whitesburg, the county seat, with a population of about 1,700 people, 145 miles (235 kilometers) southeast of Lexington. A key question is what may have led to the shooting. Stines was deposed on Monday in a lawsuit filed by two women, one of whom alleged that a deputy forced her to have sex inside Mullins’ chambers for six months in exchange for staying out of jail.",

Mark Robinson, the party's gubernatorial nominee, posted disturbing and inflammatory statements on a forum of a pornographic website.

ABC News has not independently verified the comments were made by Robinson, and he insisted in a video posted to X prior to the story's publication that \"those are not the words of Mark Robinson.\" But Robinson, a Donald Trump ally, already has a history of incendiary remarks about Jews, gay people and others, and elections in North Carolina, one of the nation's marquee swing states, rest on a knife's edge, raising questions of how much the latest news will impact his race and other Republicans on the ballot with him -- including the former president. \"I think this only heightens the level of toxicity that the Robinson campaign has, and the real question becomes, what's the radioactive fallout at the top of the ticket along with down the ballot for Republicans here in North Carolina?\" asked Michael Bitzer, the Politics Department chair at Catawba College. \"This cannot be something that the voters aren't going to recognize and probably play more into softening the Republican support.

The Texan and her husband had spent six days at sea celebrating with her brother, a Georgia police officer who had just completed cancer treatment. In two hours the couple had a flight home to Houston, where they would spend Christmas with their Marine son, who was leaving for a three-year deployment in Japan, and two other adult children. But according to a federal civil rights lawsuit filed Thursday by Box against the Broward County Sheriff's Office, its deputies wrongly arrested her as she disembarked and then jailed her for three days, subjecting her to a body cavity search and blasting her cell with death metal music and freezing air. Deputies accused the 50-year-old financial systems administrator of being a much younger woman with a similar name who was wanted in Harris County, Texas, for felony child endangerment. Harris County had mistakenly put Box's photo on its warrant, but none of the other information matched. “I’ve never done anything to where I would find myself on the other side of bars,\" Box said at a Thursday press conference near Port Everglades, Florida. \"It was really difficult for me because I had to call my kids and tell them that I wasn’t going to be there” for Christmas.",

Carlos Mauricos Acosta Galvez, 40, received 20 years in prison for the fatal DUI charge. He will be credited for the 398 days served at the Beaufort County Detention Center before trial, bringing his sentence to just under 19 years. Galvez was also convicted of causing “great bodily injury” to the driver of a Mercedes SUV, who was hospitalized after firefighters used extrication equipment to remove him from his totaled vehicle. His 15-year sentence for that charge and a three-year sentence for an unrelated misdemeanor count of domestic violence will run concurrently with his primary 20-year sentence. The Aug. 6, 2023 crash killed 54-year-old Ridgeland man Marc Garrity, who was struck by Galvez’s vehicle while turning from Buckwalter Parkway onto U.S. 278 in a Honda motorcycle. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Prosecutors say Galvez caused the collision while driving over 100 mph on U.S. 278 — nearly twice the highway’s speed limit of 55 mph — and had a blood-alcohol content of .169. He slammed into the Mercedes, causing it to strike the motorcyclist and the motorcycle to crash into a Chevrolet, according to a Thursday afternoon press release from the 14th Circuit Solicitor’s Office. Officials from the Bluffton Township Fire District, Bluffton Police Department, SC Highway Patrol, Beaufort County EMS and Beaufort County Coroner’s Office responded to a fatal crash the evening of Aug. 8, 2023 at the intersection of Buckwalter Parkway and U.S. 278.",

Running an electric vehicle (EV) can cost more than 24p per mile, while a diesel vehicle is 12.5p. It costs as much as 80p per kilowatt hour to charge an EV using a rapid or ultra-rapid device on the roadside, according to data from the app ZapMap. A typical electric car will travel 3.3 miles for every kWh of electricity used, meaning rapid and ultra-rapid chargers currently cost the equivalent of 24.1p per mile, calculations by The Times suggest. Slower chargers cost 16.4p per mile. This is about double the average diesel car, which will do 43 miles per gallon, resulting in a cost of 12.5p per mile at current prices. A typical petrol car costs 14.5p per mile, according to the analysis. A return journey from London to Penzance would cost £148 in an electric car using rapid chargers, The Times said, compared with £77 in a diesel car and £89 using petrol. It added that at-home charging is much cheaper, at less than a third of the price of the average rapid charger. ZapMap found that prices at rapid chargers have increased by 5 per cent over the past year, despite a 30 per cent decrease in the wholesale cost of electricity. This has coincided with a fall in the price of oil. Even drivers who choose slower public chargers – the threshold is 50 Wh of power, allowing a full recharge in around 30 minutes – are paying more per mile than petrol and diesel drivers.",

At Huawei's flagship shop in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, some who described themselves as \"super fans\" were annoyed after being told only those whose pre-orders had been confirmed could buy the tri-foldable Mate XT. \"I've been here since 10 p.m. last night because this tri-folding phone is a first and I'm excited to support our country,\" said a university student surnamed Ye. \"But this is very disappointing. They should have made it clear we can’t buy.\" It was a similar story at the Huawei Wangfujing store in Beijing, where access to the much-hyped Mate XT - which folds three ways like an accordion screen door - was restricted to those whose pre-orders had been confirmed.

Rui, who got to try the Mate XT in Shenzhen, said: \"I wanted to see what the fuss is about, but it's a bit big, not very practical really.\" Analysts had warned that supply chain constraints could leave potential buyers of the Mate XT empty-handed and others questioned its high cost amid a sluggish economy.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ordered flags to fly at half-staff, as many Canadians wore orange T-shirts with the slogan “Every Child Matters.”\n\nThree years later, though, no remains have been exhumed and identified.\n\nMany communities are struggling with a difficult choice: Should the sites be left undisturbed and transformed into memorial grounds, or should exhumations be done to identify any victims and return their remains to their communities?\n\nWhile there is a broad consensus in Canada that children were taken from their families and died in these schools, as the discussions and searches have dragged on, a small universe of conservative Catholic and right-wing activists have become increasingly vocal in questioning the existence of unmarked graves. They are also skeptical of the entire national reconsideration of how Canada treated Indigenous people.",

Her character, Rachel, is one of the daughters of the title, and while she thrums with palpable energy, she also has a quality of stillness about her. When Rachel stares into the distance, as she tends to do, lost in thought or maybe just lost — her huge eyes shining, her face edged by flaming red hair — she brings to mind a hummingbird hovering in midair, its wings beating impossibly fast against the strongest headwind. Rachel is the youngest of the sisters who’ve convened to care for their father, Vincent (Jay O. Sanders), at the end of his life. With her older siblings Katie (Carrie Coon) and Christina (Elizabeth Olsen), Rachel drifts through the New York apartment where their father is fading away, his heartbeat now supplanted by the beeping machinery that he’s hooked up to, which creates an eerie rhythm throughout. It’s a hard, painful setup but also absurdly funny, intimate and human. Jacobs is sensitive to life’s contradictions; he knows how abruptly love seems to boil over into hate, and how quickly adult siblings can turn into whining, raging children. Set over an inexact number of days and nights, the movie tracks the sisters during the course of their vigil. Katie is the scold (and surrogate angry patriarch), who also lives in the city, while Christina (an anxious maternal type from California) plays the part of the diplomat.",

Attending the Super Bowl as a guest of Rupert Murdoch, Musk had one of the most luxurious seats in the house, but rather than watching the game, he was glued to his phone in dismay. Both he and President Biden had sent tweets cheering on the Philadelphia Eagles, but even though Biden had far fewer followers than Musk on the platform, the president’s tweet garnered 29 million views to Musk’s 8.4 million. Livid, Musk demanded that his engineers find out why his tweet was underperforming Biden’s. He left the game early to fly back to his San Francisco office, where dozens of employees were summoned to meet him on a Sunday night. Eventually, to placate their boss, the engineers tweaked Twitter’s algorithm to boost Musk’s posts, pushing them into users’ feeds whether they follow him or not. “In effect, Musk’s tweets would have higher priority over any other post,” write Conger and Mac, technology reporters for The New York Times.

Natacha, who began working for the former Harrods owner when she was 19, described the escalating abuse she experienced from her then boss at a news conference on Friday. Survivors \"didn't really realise\" what was going on at the time, feeling that the assaults were part of the job, Natacha said. \"I have daughters and nieces and the thought of that happening to them at [a] tender age is just awful,\" she said. Warning: this story contains details some may find distressing. \"It feels odd after all these years to be able to speak about it,\" Natacha told the BBC's Helena Wilkinson at the press conference, organised by a legal team representing survivors. The case against Harrods' current owners, who the lawyers argue are liable for damages, was outlined at the conference. The current owners of the department store, who did not own it at the time of the allegations, said they were appalled by the accusations. \"The Harrods of today is a very different organisation,\" the company said in a statement. The department store has a compensation scheme for ex-employees who say they were attacked by Fayed. The company has already reached financial settlements with the majority of people who have approached them since 2023. More have contacted Harrods since a BBC investigation heard testimony from more than 20 women who said they were sexually assaulted by the billionaire.",

The woman, who the BBC is calling Melanie, believes police were close to arresting him over her allegations just days before he died in August 2023. A BBC investigation published on Thursday revealed that more than 20 women said they were sexually assaulted by the billionaire. Five said they were raped. Melanie is one of a growing number of additional ex-Harrods employees to tell the BBC they were attacked since the documentary and podcast Al-Fayed: Predator at Harrods was released. The BBC investigation gathered evidence that during Fayed's ownership, Harrods not only failed to intervene, but helped cover up abuse allegations. Melanie's testimony comes as new details emerge of failed efforts by police and prosecutors to hold Fayed to account during his life. A legal team representing many of the women the BBC has spoken to, will outline their case against Harrods on Friday. Warning: this story contains details some may find distressing. 'Sleazebag... slimy'\n\nMelanie worked at Harrods for a few years prior to 2010. She described being hired there as a 21-year-old as a \"dream job\". She met Fayed - who was in his late seventies at the time - at work meetings on two occasions, before being summoned to his apartment on London's Park Lane in late 2007. Melanie says she went to the evening meeting despite the invitation \"ringing the alarm bells\".",

Giving harrowing details of what is alleged to have taken place, the legal team and one of Fayed's many alleged victims recounted how the former owner of Harrods used his power to force himself on women, had them followed and made them have sexual health checks. The legal team representing 37 women who say they were sexually assaulted or raped by the late billionaire spoke publicly to outline how the former Harrods boss used \"his wealth and power to manipulate and control victims\". Here are five things we learned. Warning: this story contains details some may find distressing. 'Serial sexual abuser'\n\nFayed was a \"serial sexual abuser\" whose abuse was \"constant and repetitive\" over 25 years, barrister Dean Armstrong KC said. \"I have many years of practice... I have never seen a case as horrific as this,\" he told the news conference. \"This case combines some of the most horrific elements of the cases involving Jimmy Savile, Jeffrey Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. \"Savile because in this case, as in that, the institution, we say, knew about the behaviour\", Mr Armstrong continued. \"Epstein because in that case, as in this, there was a procurement system in place to source the women and girls. As you know, there are some very young victims. \"And Weinstein, because it was a person at the very top of the organisation who was abusing his power.",

Lebanon and Hezbollah, whose members and communication systems were targeted, have blamed Israel – though Israel is yet to comment. The BBC has followed a trail from Taiwan, to Japan, Hungary, Israel and back to Lebanon. Here are the unanswered questions. How were the pagers compromised? Some early speculation suggested that the pagers could have been targeted by a complex hack that caused them to explode. But that theory was quickly dismissed by experts. To cause damage on the scale that they did, it is probable they were rigged with explosives before they entered Hezbollah’s possession, experts say. Images of the broken remains of the pagers show the logo of a small Taiwanese electronics manufacturer: Gold Apollo. The BBC visited the company’s offices, situated on a large business park in a nondescript suburb of Taipei. The company's founder, Hsu Ching-Kuang, seemed shocked. He denied the business had anything to do with the operation. “You look at the pictures from Lebanon,” he told reporters outside his firm's offices. \"They don’t have any mark saying Made in Taiwan on them, we did not make those pagers!” Instead - he pointed to a Hungarian company: BAC Consulting. Mr Hsu said that three years ago he had licensed Gold Apollo’s trademark to BAC, allowing them to use Gold Apollo’s name on their own pagers.",

And for the first time, volunteers - civilians who joined the armed forces after the start of the war - now make up the highest number of people killed on the battlefield since Russia’s full-scale invasion began in 2022. Every day, the names of those killed in Ukraine, their obituaries and photographs from their funerals are published across Russia in the media and on social networks. BBC Russian and the independent website Mediazona have collated these names, along with names from other open sources, including official reports. We checked that the information had been shared by authorities or relatives of the deceased - and that they had been identified as dying in the war. New graves in cemeteries have also helped provide the names of soldiers killed in Ukraine - these are usually marked by flags and wreaths sent by the defence ministry. We have identified the names of 70,112 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine, but the actual number is believed to be considerably higher. Some families do not share details of their relatives’ deaths publicly - and our analysis does not include names we were unable to check, or the deaths of militia in Russian-occupied Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine. Among them, 13,781 were volunteers - about 20% - and fatalities among volunteers now exceed other categories. Former prisoners, who joined up in return for pardons for their crimes, were previously the highest but they now account for 19% of all confirmed deaths.",

An old tourist sign boasts of a border with Myanmar made of just “bamboo fences, ditches and earth ridges” - a sign of the easy economic relationship Beijing had sought to build with its neighbour. Now the border the BBC visited is marked by a high, metal fence running through the county of Ruili in Yunnan province. Topped by barbed wire and surveillance cameras in some places, it cuts through rice fields and carves up once-adjoined streets. China’s tough pandemic lockdowns forced the separation initially. But it has since been cemented by the intractable civil war in Myanmar, triggered by a bloody coup in 2021. The military regime is now fighting for control in large swathes of the country, including Shan State along China’s border, where it has suffered some of its biggest losses. The crisis at its doorstep - a nearly 2,000km (1,240-mile) border - is becoming costly for China, which has invested millions of dollars in Myanmar for a critical trade corridor. The ambitious plan aims to connect China’s landlocked south-west to the Indian Ocean via Myanmar. But the corridor has become a battleground between Myanmar rebels and the country's army. Beijing has sway over both sides but the ceasefire it brokered in January fell apart. It has now turned to military exercises along the border and stern words. Foreign Minister Wang Yi was the latest diplomat to visit Myanmar’s capital Nay Pyi Taw and is thought to have delivered a warning to the country's ruler Min Aung Hlaing.",

        "text": "The cancers with longest treatment waits revealed\n\nGetty Images\n\nThere is an unacceptable variation in waits for treatment of different cancers in England, an exclusive analysis for BBC News by Cancer Research UK shows. Patients with cancers affecting the head and neck and bowel are the most likely to face long waits – just over half are seen within the target of 62 days. In comparison, patients with blood, bone marrow and skin cancers are the most likely to start treatment in time. The charity said the differences were putting lives at risk, highlighting a study suggesting a four-week delay to surgery increases the risk of dying by 6-8% for many cancers. Jayne Gray, from Leicestershire, died in 2021, aged 64, after bladder cancer led to kidney failure. Despite a history of cancer, Jayne had waited 74 days for treatment to start, after an urgent referral from her GP. Bladder cancer is a type of urological cancer, which the Cancer Research UK analysis shows has one of the longest waits. Amy Gray Jayne Gray (right) died in 2021, after waiting longer than the target time of 62 days for treatment\n\nJayne’s daughter, Amy, 38, said: “It was torture waiting for her treatment to start - she should have been a priority. “We will always be left wondering whether it would have been different if she had been seen more quickly.” Cancer Research UK said various factors were behind the differences in waiting times, including more acute shortages of specialist staff for some cancers and the fact some could take longer and were more complex to diagnose. Some also have more referrals than others.",

Mustard ingredients - including mustard powder or flour - can be found in dips, sauces, salads and pre-packed sandwiches, the FSA said. It is trying to identify how many products may be affected - around 50 have already been recalled. Parents of children with a peanut allergy should check the labels of food they are buying and ask restaurants and take-away outlets about foods that might contain mustard, the agency says. Some of the products being recalled, or removed from sale, because they may contain peanuts include Dominos dips, SPAR sandwich fillers and salads, and Harvester BBQ sauce. The Food Standards Agency has traced the contaminated mustard ingredients to a producer in India called GT Agro Industries. One company, called FGS Ingredients, has been identified as supplying their mustard ingredients for use in UK food. Because of how serious allergic reactions to peanuts can be, the FSA says it is taking a precautionary approach, so that people with allergies can keep themselves safe. Rebecca Sudworth, director of food policy at the FSA, said: “Those with a peanut allergy should avoid consuming products containing mustard as an ingredient until we identify the individual products affected. \"As soon as we have more information, we will update consumers,\" she added. According to the agency, if mustard is present in a food, it should be labelled in bold on the packet because it is an allergen itself.",

After a laugh, the Democratic presidential nominee continued: \"I probably shouldn't have said that, but my staff will deal with that later.\" Harris, who highlighted during the recent presidential debate that she was a gun-owner, went on to reiterate that she supported a ban on assault weapons. A firearm of that type was \"literally designed to be a tool of war\", she told Winfrey. \"It has no place on the streets of a civil society.\" Harris's opponents have increasingly pointed to Harris's attitude on guns as being indicative of her shifting policy positions ahead of the November election. While she stressed her support for an assault weapons ban on Thursday, last week's ABC News debate moderator noted that the Democrat no longer supported a \"buyback\" programme that would force gun owners to hand over their AR-15s and other assault-style weapons to the government. Buyback proposals gained steam during the 2020 Democratic presidential primary race, with Harris voicing her support at the time. \"We have to have a buyback programme, and I support a mandatory gun buyback programme,\" she said in October 2019. During the presidential debate, Harris did not directly explain why she no longer supported the buyback idea.",

The bronze blade, thought to be around 3,000 years old, has the markings of Ramesses II, hailed as the most powerful king of ancient Egypt. Many scholars, as well as Hollywood movies, have suggested that Ramesses was the pharaoh who enslaved the Israelites in the Book of Exodus\n\nAs the story goes, Moses freed the group from the pharaoh's control, then famously parted the Red Sea and delivered the Israelites to the Promise Land. The sword was uncovered among the ruins of an ancient military fort in Housh Eissa, a city just south of Alexandria, which featured barracks for soldiers and storage rooms for food, weapons and other goods. The shimmering sword found in Egypt likely belonged to a high-ranking military official under the reign of Ramesses II who some scholars claimed is the pharaoh mentioned in the Bible\n\nRamesses, who ruled from 1279 to 1213BC, was known for his military power and strategic genius, leading an army of around 100,000 men strong. The ancient sword likely did not belong to the famous king, but likely to one of his soldiers stationed at the fort, experts said. Elizabeth Frood, an Oxford University Egyptologist who was not involved in the dig, told The Washington Post: 'An object to bear the cartouches of Rameses II would suggest to me that it belonged to someone of relatively high rank. 'To be able to display such an object, even though it would have been presumably in a scabbard, was a marker of status and prestige.' The sword was uncovered at a site called Tell Al-Abqain, which experts said was 'a crucial military outpost.'",

Only a few hundred infants have ever been diagnosed with Griscelli syndrome, which decimates their immune systems to the point that a common cold becomes deadly. The syndrome also leads to problems with cells that give skin and hair their pigment, meaning babies with Griscellis have gray-white hair, eyebrows and, sometimes, skin. Doctors in India have highlighted two new cases in India which they hope will raise awareness about the syndrome and help doctors diagnose it. Baby girl number two from the case study had gray hair on her head, and the soft, small hair all over her body was also light in color, the doctors reported\n\nYour browser does not support iframes. The doctors describe how to test for the condition and treat it, as quick and early intervention can make the difference in saving these children's lives. 'Silver hair syndrome in a neonate might be a unique presentation of an underlying serious systemic illness and the exact presentation of these syndromes in the neonatal period remains less known,' the case report, from doctors at King Edward Memorial Hospital said. The two babies were born with gray-white hair at separate times in India. They were both diagnosed with Griscelli and died died within months of being born, according to the case report published in the journal Oxford Medical Case Reports. The first child was born prematurely, and her silver hair confirmed that she had Griscelli. The child also had an older sibling who had been born with silver hair, and had developmental delays, but was otherwise healthy.",

Good old Bridget, I said to myself, as I was folded in the arms of Morpheus. Still at it, eh? I mused. It appears that our heroine will, after 30 years, still be gamely in search of a boyfriend in Mad About The Boy. My eyelids were drooping, but I formed the distinct impression that this time she was actually going to succeed. Incredible, I thought drowsily, when you think of her age (surely 55 plus? ), and when you consider how much more difficult it has all become. When Bridget Jones first started to record her romantic struggles, back in 1995, she struck a chord with millions of people – especially women – who couldn’t find the right partner. They wanted love; they wanted ­happiness, and all other things being equal they probably wanted to get hitched and even to have children. It was the tragicomic predicament of Bridget Jones that she was clever, funny, attractive – and yet couldn’t find the right man. ‘Tick-tock, tick-tock’, her friends would say to her at dinner parties, in a bullying way, to remind her that she might have only a few child-bearing years to go. Since then the obstacles have, if anything, got even bigger. If you are a professional woman like Bridget – who, in the stories, is a TV news producer – you have to think about the exorbitant costs of childcare, which have been steadily increasing, as a proportion of income.",

Government lawyers had argued that because burglar Steven Wilson, 36, had 'next to no history' of having earned an honest penny in his life, a multimillion-pound payout would be 'out of accord with what society would perceive as being reasonable'. Wilson suffered injuries including a torn liver, fractured spine and lacerated spinal cord when convicted murderer Patrick Chandler attacked him 'out of the blue' in July 2018 with a nine-inch knife whilst they both worked in the kitchen at HMP Chelmsford. He later sued, claiming the MoJ failed to adequately assess whether violent lifer Chandler was safe for kitchen work, given the opportunity to access knives and sharp items. The MoJ admitted liability for the attack and agreed that Wilson is due compensation, but argued that, because he had a 20-year criminal record, with 'next to no history' of having earned an honest penny, he should not get the £5million-plus damages he was claiming. At the time of the attack, Wilson was on remand for an aggravated burglary, for which he was later sentenced to six-and-a-half years' imprisonment. Wilson was stabbed in the stomach with such force that it lifted him off the ground, but survived with a range of severe injuries\n\nWilson suffered injuries including a torn liver, fractured spine and lacerated spinal cord when convicted murderer Patrick Chandler (above) attacked him 'out of the blue'\n\nBut at the High Court this morning, Judge Melissa Clarke awarded Wilson a compensation payout of just under £5.5m, while also ordering the government to pay his £546,000 lawyers' bill on top.",

Professor Michael Biggs, trustee of the charity Sex Matters, launched a campaign for the latest census data to be looked at again after the ONS suggested there are 262,000 transgender people in the UK. He finally saw some vindication last week after the Office for Statistics Regulations (OSR), the industry watchdog, said in a damning report that the figures were unreliable and must be discarded as an 'accredited official statistic'. It was the first time in more than 220 years of the census that data had been downgraded. The furore began when the 2021 Office for National Statistics (ONS) census – the first to count transgender people – had asked the question: 'Is the gender you identify with the same as your sex registered at birth?' Oxford University professor Professor Michael Biggs says he was shunned and branded a 'transphobe' during a two-year battle to convince the Office for National Statistics it had massively overstated the number of transgender people in Britain\n\nBut the sociology professor instinctively felt there was something not quite right with the figures, when it identified Brent, in northwest London - his home borough - as second to Newham, in east London, with the highest numbers of transgender people. According to the numbers, Newham - at 1.5 per cent - and Brent - at 1.3 per cent - had the highest proportion of transgender people in the UK. If true, these boroughs had trans communities around a third higher in population than Brighton & Hove, where LGBT communities are well-established.",

Katie is capable and controlling, Rachel terminally laidback and Christina warmly emotional, and the tense and sometimes subtly humorous conversations between them, as they try to find their way through the situation, unfold in the manner of a play. If you watch closely you'll see a lot of fine details in the acting, especially in the way the sisters react to each other - watch the difference between what's on their faces and what they actually say. A fair amount of tension builds up from all this, and that makes the turn the story takes in the last third all the more powerful. It's a rewarding film as a result, essentially a celebration of family - and also an uncommonly open and deftly humorous portrait of a time of life that often gets glossed over.",

The proposal to demolish Ashe Park, a Hampshire residence where the celebrated author loved to spend her time, has been submitted by the new homeowners, believed to be from Hong Kong or China. The 232-acre estate near Basingstoke has been described as a 'perfect elegant country home' sitting amongst rolling parkland and space for shooting and fishing in the grounds. The house itself has seven bedrooms including a 'palatial' master chamber, five reception rooms and an 'ornate' library. There are also several outbuildings including a 'party barn' with a cinema, a polo ground, and an 'exceptional' garden with fruit trees and wildflowers.

But the owners find it 'tired' and 'unmanaged'\n\nBut its new owners feel it is 'tired and unmanaged', 'lacks architectural merit' and want to replace it with an entirely new house. Property records show Ashe Park was bought in October 2022 for an eye-watering £17million by Shuk Ting Sharon Leung and Gillian Sin Hang Ho. The oldest parts of the property date back to the 1600s and historic literary figure Austen wrote in her letters about attending balls there in the 1790s. Austen was born in Steventon Rectory, just a mile from the house, and next year is the 250th anniversary of the Pride and Prejudice author's birth. Planning documents show that the new owners claim the current property is 'tired and unmanaged'.",

In the 10-year run-up to retirement age, people with invested pension funds typically see them shifted out of stock markets and all or part way into bonds, historically regarded as a 'safer' option, and cash. Some 64 per cent are unaware that this de-risking process, known as lifestyling but also sometimes called target-dating, usually happens to pension funds during the period before retirement unless you take active steps to avoid it. Pension lifestyling: In the 10-year run-up to retirement age, people with invested pots typically see them shifted out of stock markets and all or part way into bonds and cash\n\nMeanwhile, just 40 per cent know where their pension is currently invested, according to the survey by RBC Brewin Dolphin. This means millions of people's plans for retirement hinge on ‘lifestyle’ pensions that may not be suitable for them, says the firm. The lifestyling strategy was originally created to position people to buy an annuity, but most people now stay invested in drawdown schemes to fund retirement. Anyone who wants to keep their pension fund invested, perhaps for decades to come in retirement, might want to consider whether it is better to opt out of 'lifestyling' altogether and stick with stocks, which are riskier but have more potential for long-term growth. A bond market crash last autumn meant some older workers who had been defaulted into lifetyled funds discovered to their horror they were sitting on huge losses right on the brink of retirement, which some were forced to delay as a result.",

'If there is a risk that mustard could be unintentionally present in food there will be a ‘may contain’ label for mustard. 'If you are eating out, please ask the cafe or restaurant staff if any of their products contain mustard – by law, food businesses must provide this information to customers.'

Adults in the UK sink 39 bottles Sauvignon blanc and Merlot on average each year, data shows. Consumption has soared 12-fold since the 1960s, partly fuelled by higher boozing rates among women. Beer intake, meanwhile, has more than halved since its heyday five decades ago – from the equivalent of 276 pints a year to 110. Industry experts today claimed wine's overthrowing of beer as Britain's best-loved drink was 'a long time coming'. Others guessed the booming popularity of spirits might also see beer overtaken again in the near future. Your browser does not support iframes. Your browser does not support iframes. Figures compiled by the World Health Organization (WHO) show how much alcohol is consumed via different drinks. The typical Briton aged 15 or over consumes 9.75l of pure alcohol each year. How to work out how much pure alcohol is in your drink\n\nMultiply the total number of millilitres by the amount of pure alcohol (ABV). For instance, consider a 750ml bottle of Sauvignon blanc at 14%. To calculate how much pure alcohol this contain, you would multiply 750 by 0.14. This would give you 105ml. Advertisement\n\nBroken down, this includes 3.55l of alcohol from wine. For comparison, the figure stood at 0.3l in the early-60s. This amounts to close to three bottles. As of 2020, the most recent year there are figures for, we consume 3.12l of alcohol from beer. Wine's surging popularity is thought, in part, to be due to it becoming much more common for women to drink.",

Though first developed in Chicago in 1930, and named after the company's family horse 'Snickers', it was bestowed a new name once it launched on foreign shores. The iconic American chocolate bar is made of nougat, topped with caramel and peanuts, and encased in milk chocolate - but despite its success, most people don't know the unique backstory behind the chocolate bar's name. And with news of a first-of-its-kind limited edition Snickers hitting supermarket shelves, there's no better time to set the record straight. Known around the world as Snickers for the last 94 years, it took on a very different title when it officially launched in Britain in 1967. Known globally as Snickers for the last century, it took on a very different title when it officially launched in Britain in 1967 (Stock image)\n\nSnickers opted to retitle the beloved chocolate bar 'Marathon', the name the owners have currently rebranded to, as part of a nostalgic throwback campaign for its fans. Back in the late 60s, Brits were able to get their hands on a brand new Marathon bar, perhaps none the wiser it was the exact same chocolate - bar the packaging - enjoyed by hundreds of millions of people around the globe. Legend has it that Snickers execs changed the name to Marathon once it hit the UK because the original name rhymes with 'knickers'. To avoid controversy and keep their fans happy, they relabelled their popular chocolate, a change that lasted for a whopping 23 years, from 1967 to 1990.",

But that balance shifts after a year in power, with 50 per cent insisting there will be no passing the buck by that stage compared to 42 per cent who argued it was still valid.

Worryingly for the PM, the polling for the PoliticsHome website also found that fewer than one in seven Brits think there will be any noticeable improvement to life in the UK in the next year. More than a third of the public, including a fifth of 2024 Labour voters, said Sir Keir had been too negative about the challenges facing the UK - although a similar proportion believed they were being realistic.

In a new video, Professor Tim Spector, founder of the ZOE diet app, showed how additives called emulsifiers form a gel-like clump in our guts. The clip shows the nutrition expert demonstrating what happens to emulsifiers — used to add bulk to food — in our bowel, by mixing the powder in a bowl with liquid. The clump it forms, he says, plays havoc with the millions of healthy bacteria that live there and are vital for protecting us from diseases like cancer and heart disease. Emulsifiers are used in thousands of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) to help bind ingredients that don't usually mix, like oil and water. Professor Tim Spector has demonstrated the stomach-churning effect of emulsifiers in the gut\n\nThey are found in a range of popular products, including bread, cakes, breakfast cereals and childrens yoghurts. Some experts have linked increasing consumption of additives like emulsifiers with the rise in early onset bowel cancer. Nutrition Lead at Imperial College London Dr Federica Amati explained last month the damage that emulsifiers 'messes up' the separation between the fatty layer and water layer in the gut. This, it has been theorised, breaks down the gut lining, leading to bacterial infections. Last month, microbiome expert Dr Alasdair Scott told The Mail on Sunday: 'We think that this process could be linked to bowel cancer. 'Studies done on animals that confirm this, but not yet on people — in humans it can be much more difficult to prove why exactly a tumour has formed.'",

        "text": "Leading neurosurgeon Dr Eben Alexander was sceptical when anyone said they had experienced the afterlife. But then he had a similar experience after going into a coma. In our final extract from his book, The Map Of Heaven, Dr Alexander — who has worked at Harvard Medical School — explains that there is one thing that endures after we die: love. Science cannot explain the afterlife. For many people who use scientific evidence as the sole basis of their belief system, this must mean the afterlife doesn’t exist. According to them, death is the end and heaven is a convenient lie we tell to ourselves and our children. My 25-year career as an academic neuroscientist, studying the workings of the brain, led me to the conclusion that life after death was a brain-based illusion — until I experienced a journey into the hereafter during a coma after developing meningitis. Now I hold a very different view: the afterlife is real. If science doesn’t recognise this fact, then it is doing two things wrong. In his vision of the afterlife, Dr Eben Alexander was a speck perched on the wing of a butterfly\n\nFirst, science often uses the wrong tools to make measurements. And second, even the most open-minded scientists are a long way from understanding what the right tools will be. We simply haven’t discovered the scientific answers to spiritual questions yet. As a simple example, imagine a young couple at their wedding. As the ceremony ends, they look deep into each other’s eyes — the windows of the soul, as Shakespeare called them.",

Fermanagh and Omagh District Council said it's environmental health service went on to receive a further 10 complaints up to April of this year. Conspiracy theories about what was causing the noise - that one resident says 'went on for hours and hours' - began to spread far and wide.

John Boyle, the council's director of community and wellbeing at the council, told his colleagues that 'unless there are formal, public legal proceedings, we would not be naming the source of that noise', The Times reports. Boyle reported the findings to the regeneration and community committee, in which he revealed how the experts went about trying to trace the source. He wrote: 'A calibrated recording of the hum' was made using a sound level meter within a complainant's home and shared with the noise consultant who identified 'a significant dominant acoustic tone considered to be an indicative component of the hum … This distinct tone was likely to be associated with the operation of a fan or ventilation-type equipment.'",

A big chunky burger has appealed to hungry Brits for decades but now a distinctly flatter bite to eat is cementing itself as one of the UK's favourites. While they're not particularly new, our love for them is showcased courtesy of social media, where you'll find literally hundreds of thousands of posts dedicated to these simple-but-perfect creations. Burgers are everywhere, with big hitters not just in the capital but across the country, attracting regular queues of aficionados at restaurants and shops as well as street food vendors. There's something about the crispy crust, thin patties and general oozy goodness that is unrivalled. Ellen Manning made smash burgers at home - starting with beef mince\n\nShe then 'smashed it down'. It creates a crunchy thinner patty - using the 'maillard' effect\n\nThe key is in the Maillard reaction - named after French chemist Louis Camille Maillard, who discovered that when amino acids and reducing sugars react, they create a distinctive flavour in the browned result that gets our taste buds tingling in a way that's strangely addictive. Achieving this reaction in a burger takes plenty of heat, good meat, and the trademark 'smashing' technique that sees balls of minced beef squished and squashed until the patty itself is thin as thin can be, with the crust we have all come to love. We might not have big rigs in our own homes, designed to smash hundreds of patties on a production line to feed hungry burger-lovers. But we can recreate a few of our own with the right tactics.The starting point is the meat itself.",

New York City-based banker Renata Rojas delivered harrowing testimony about the doomed mission on the fourth day of a public hearing into tragedy, which is being held by the US Coast Guard Marine Board of Investigation in South Carolina. She described her role in helping the launch last June and said that all on board understood the risks involved in their dive deep beneath the Atlantic Ocean to see the wreck of the Titanic. 'This was never sold as a Disney ride,' she said. 'It was an expedition that … things happen and you have to adapt to change.' The inquiry, which will last two weeks, has seen new evidence come to light as investigators probe exactly what happened in the hours between the vessel losing contact with its support vessel and its implosion 3,700 metres below the surface. A chilling 3D reconstruction of the Titan's final journey was released by the US Coast Guard, depicting its final movements, after new footage of the wreckage on the seabed was also revealed, taken days after tragedy unfolded. Ms Rojas testified that she had herself taken part in test dives before the disaster on June 18, adding: 'I knew what I was doing was very risky,' she said. 'I never at any point felt unsafe by the operation.' She is one of several people to have appeared before the ongoing hearing, but her testimony was different from others who have largely described a dysfunctional operation destined for failure. Another witness - OceanGate's scientific director - said that the submersible had malfunctioned just three days before the tragedy, noting that he did not know whether it had been checked over before its fateful voyage.",

Each year cars kill roughly 40,000 people there—and not just because it is a big place where people love to drive. The country’s roads are nearly twice as dangerous per mile driven as those in the rest of the rich world. Deaths there involving cars have increased over the past decade, despite the introduction of technology meant to make driving safer. Weight is to blame. Our analysis of 7.5m crashes showed that for every 10,000 crashes the heaviest vehicles kill 37 people in the other car, compared with just 2.6 for the lightest. And the situation is getting worse. In 2023, 31% of new cars in America weighed over 5,000lb (2.27 tonnes), compared with 22% in 2018. This poses a giant collective-action problem.

Yet all these attempts are likely to fail, because they are built on a misapprehension. The bulk of the decline in the fertility rate in such countries is among younger, poorer women who are delaying when they start to have children, and who therefore have fewer overall. Focusing on these women as a group would be bad for them and for society. Teenage pregnancies are linked to poverty and ill health for both mother and child.

The agency said it filed a complaint in its administrative court alleging that CVS’s Caremark, Cigna’s Express Scripts and UnitedHealth’s Optum Rx accepted money from drugmakers in exchange for keeping lower-cost insulin off their lists of approved drugs. The companies’ affiliated group purchasing organizations — started in recent years to negotiate rebate payments with drugmakers — were also named. The enforcement action is part of an escalating conflict between the FTC and the three pharmacy benefit managers that together control about 80% of prescriptions filled in the US. Since the companies have merged with larger health conglomerates that also own insurers, pharmacies, and doctors clinics, they’ve faced intensifying pressure in Washington. The drug gatekeepers favored versions of insulin with higher upfront prices and bigger rebate payments from pharmaceutical companies, which shifted more costs onto patients, the FTC alleged. The PBMs collected billions in rebates and fees as the list price of a common insulin, Humalog, rose 1,200% between 1999 and 2017, the agency said. It didn’t make its filing available immediately, but described it in materials shared with reporters. The administrative complaint starts a process whereby the allegations will be tried in a formal hearing before an administrative law judge, the agency said. Shares of the big PBMs’ parent companies dipped on the news, with CVS falling 1.8% at 12:58 pm. Cigna and UnitedHealth were both down less than 1%.",

People who were morbidly obese or just slightly overweight suddenly saw the possibility that they could have the svelte body image they wanted.

Binance agreed to pay a $4.3 million fine to resolve the matter, one of the largest such settlements in U.S. history. In the wake of this transition of leadership, Binance saw an outflow of nearly $1 billion and its native coin, BNB, abruptly fell by 9%. At the time, it was uncertain if Teng would be able to shore up confidence in Binance but, based on his remarks, it appears the company has turned the page on its legal troubles and continued to grow. A former regulator, Teng has sought to shake off Binance’s lawless reputation, in part by adopting a measured tone and leaning into compliance efforts. In the wake of the historic settlement, he has made significant changes to the company’s corporate structure. This has included introducing a board of seven directors as part of an effort to distance the company from Zhao, though most are company insiders.

It’s pet areas and happy hours. “Listings with a turfed pet area, coworking space or community happy hours are drawing more interest as renters appear to be prioritizing practical amenities and community-focused perks,” the analysis read. Completely understandable, in my mind. Who doesn’t love puppies and cocktails? For the analysis, Zillow looked at almost six million rental listings, from apartment complexes to single family homes, and found specific amenities that contributed to more saves and shares per day—a signal of demand, it said. To be clear, this isn’t a science, everyone likes different things. Still, “the most in-demand amenities are off-street parking and in-unit laundry,” according to Zillow. Listings with mentions of off-street parking received 85% more saves and 103% more shares; those with mentions of in-unit laundry received 76% more saves and 67% more shares per day. Of course, those two are somewhat necessary and practical. Fun comes after. Homes with pet-friendly spots resulted in 76% more daily saves and 91% shares; homes with air filtration mechanisms (less fun, but more or less practical in a post-pandemic world) got 72% more saves and 79% more shares; places that offer happy hours got 50% more saves and 67% shares; and rentals with coworking spaces got 16% more saves and 23% more shares.",

Rutter spoke with McKinsey senior partner Ian Jefferson about the critical role of technology in the arts and how digital art forms can heighten the live experience. An edited transcript of their conversation follows. Ian Jefferson: Coming out of COVID-19, there was a ramp-up in the use of digital platforms and digital access to the arts. Recently, there has been an increase in conversations about generative AI and its role in the arts. Have you seen technology change the way the arts are performed, created, and experienced?

Workforce planning missteps can result in reduced margins and degraded customer service. These workforce challenges affect more than three million people employed at the 40 top-grossing travel and logistics companies. About the authors This article is a collaborative effort by Jorge Amar, Neal Parikh, Sal Arora, Scott McConnell, and Taylor Cornwall, with Joseph Faucher, representing views from McKinsey’s Travel, Logistics & Infrastructure Practice. Companies have limited control over the future cost and availability of labor. But proper strategies can help maximize a frontline workforce’s productivity, ensuring the right number of employees are deployed to the right places at the right times. This can build resiliency to handle unexpected events. Across travel and logistics companies—such as airlines, hotels, logistics services providers, and others—significant value could be created through improved workforce management that simultaneously incorporates long-range, near-term, and day-to-day goals. Today’s challenges stem from decisions made over past decades. Although they are rich with data, many companies have underinvested in the foundations and optimization tools that would allow them to use that data to plan more effectively. With limited visibility, workforce planning is often driven by outdated assumptions and methods, frequently resulting in situations where complex workforces are managed using overly simple models and spreadsheets. The tools companies currently use often lack the precision and agility needed to handle today’s workforce complexities in an ever-changing operating environment. Newer solutions, such as generative AI (gen AI), can integrate large and disparate data sets to generate fresh capabilities and greater workforce agility.",

For Europe, McKinsey estimates that, by 2030, more than 300,000 public and private charge points will be required across the continent for medium- and heavy-duty trucks, up from roughly 10,000 today. The creation of this new infrastructure represents a significant challenge. Building out robust networks of chargers will require approximately €40 billion of capital investment until 2040. Of this, €7 billion of investments are needed until 2030, less than a quarter of which has been publicly committed today. It will also be energy-intensive, consuming 20 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity annually by 2030, roughly 0.5 percent of Europe’s total electricity demand. Gaining access to all this energy will often mean securing additional capacity on an already congested grid. At the same time, the possibilities are wide open. With no incumbent players fully established in the electric truck–charging market, companies from a variety of arenas have an opportunity to shape the ecosystem of market participants, creating new businesses or forging strategic collaborations. This article is based on charging infrastructure research from the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility and McKinsey’s EV Charging Infrastructure Service Line. We look at how Europe’s charging network will evolve over the next decade and beyond, identifying major challenges players will need to solve for. Our analysis also details the steps fleet operators will need to take as they develop strategies for a successful scale-up of their truck charging infrastructure—efforts that will inevitably require collaborative actions from fleet operators; truck manufacturers; turnkey engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) firms; finance providers; and energy and infrastructure players.",

Revenues have stagnated amid outflows from higher-fee active equity mutual funds and a period of adjustment in the private markets. And profitability has remained under pressure amid rising costs. The good news: lifted by strong market performance and healthier net flows, the industry’s global assets under management (AUM) reached a record $132 trillion as of June 2024. The bad news: 2023 revenues were essentially flat compared with the previous year and profits shrank 5 percent. Certain asset management companies have still been able to achieve above-market growth, but share gains amid stagnant industry economics only get organizations so far. Outsize growth needs to come from new pools of assets outside the industry. Fortunately, new opportunities are prevalent because of disruption and dislocation in the balance sheets of banks, insurance companies, and high-net-worth investors. By our estimates, these changes could bring the industry $8 trillion to $10 trillion of new managed assets over the next decade. This year’s report explores the following six themes:\n\nthe unevenness of the industry’s rebound from a weak 2022, with considerable variation across regions, channels, and product types\n\nthe nature of the revenue-neutral recovery of 2023, driven in large part by lower-priced investment strategies attracting the bulk of recovery inflows\n\nthe pressures on profitability, including the upward creep in the industry’s cost base, despite 2023 purportedly being “the year of austerity”\n\nthe shifting basis of competition as several of the largest asset managers continue to gain market share, and as the traditional focus on investment performance alone is no longer considered a surefire way to succeed\n\nan opportunity beyond the balance sheet—$8 trillion to $10 trillion that could be unlocked as banks, insurers, and individual high-net-worth investors restructure their allocations and holdings\n\na new agenda for not just surviving but thriving in this rapidly shifting market environment—an agenda that North American asset managers should consider over the next 12 to 18 months\n\nOur 2024 review of the industry shows an interesting dichotomy.",

Over the past decade, governments, fleet operators, and truck OEMs have realized this need for action and have gone to significant lengths to make this positive change happen. Today, the only effective way to reduce these emissions is by switching from combustion engines powered by fossil fuels to zero-emission propulsion systems or other carbon-neutral fuels. Several potential carbon-neutral alternatives to diesel combustion engines exist, including hydrogen engines and biofuels or synthetic fuels (synfuels); however, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are considered suitable propulsion systems for most commercial vehicle use cases and are expected to dominate the market, especially in the short term. This publication discusses why investing in battery electric trucks is key to capturing the truck market and how OEMs can think strategically about pursuing battery technologies with a consideration for circularity. Why batteries are the way forward for trucks\n\nRegulators across the globe have set ambitious emissions targets for truck OEMs. For instance, the European Commission has set some of the tightest emission regulations, requiring a 45 percent emissions reduction in new-vehicle sales by 2030 compared to 2019 levels and 90 percent reduction by 2040. To enable OEMs in this transition and drive innovation, regulators have encouraged truck OEMs to consider a variety of technologies. In 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States emphasized this by stating that its “standards are performance-based, such that manufacturers are not required to use particular technologies” to meet the standards. The alternatives to diesel\n\nCurrently, the most viable alternatives to diesel are BEVs, hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (H 2 -FCEVs), hydrogen internal combustion engines (H 2 -ICEs), and renewable fuels.",

In this third and final article in our series on K–12 district funding, we follow the flow of funds to attempt to answer three key questions:\n\nQuick look The US government’s Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) Fund allocated $190 billion in federal funding to public schools to address the impact of COVID-19. Three rounds of stimulus bills were passed in 2020 and 2021, with the final round set to expire on September 30, 2024. We surveyed school administrators in 2022 and 2023 on their expectations for ESSER spending. In this year’s survey (see sidebar, “About the survey”), respondents reflect on the overall impact of stimulus funding and the effectiveness of their allocations. Did K–12 districts spend the stimulus effectively and meet their priorities? How can district leaders navigate the end of stimulus funding? What are schools likely to spend on in the poststimulus years to come? District leaders believe that stimulus funding was effective but wish they had spent more on late-pandemic priorities\n\nAbout the survey In June–July 2024, McKinsey surveyed 480-plus US K–12 public and charter school district administrators who either provide input into a district’s school year budget or are decision makers who set the budget. The survey asked questions about Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund (ESSER) spending, expectations for future spending without stimulus funds—which expire in September 2024—and districts’ future priorities. Respondents to the survey represented a cross section of districts by size (60 percent small, 17 percent medium, and 23 percent large); geography (38 percent urban, 47 percent suburban or town, and 15 percent rural); and income level (45 percent higher-income districts—with less than 40 percent of students eligible for free and reduced lunch—and 55 percent lower-income districts, with more than 40 percent of students eligible for free and reduced lunch).",

The promise is enormous, with the economic value of generative AI (gen AI) potentially reaching $4.4 trillion, with a large percentage of that value set to come from marketing and sales. Amid the excitement about the speed of innovation, there’s also a sense of uncertainty, with many companies unsure about how to navigate this brave new world. Two companies at the forefront of this transformation are Salesforce and Solo Brands. Salesforce has long been at the leading edge of data management and technology, and earlier this year launched its new Einstein AI tools to help sales teams better understand their customers and help marketing teams better personalize campaigns at scale. Solo Brands, which was founded in 2011 and makes innovative outdoor products such as smokeless fire pits and foldable kayaks, recently launched an AI-powered chatbot that helps customer service agents focus on priority issues and improved customer satisfaction. At Salesforce’s recent Connections conference, Salesforce president and chief marketing officer Ariel Kelman and Jenna Posner, then the chief digital officer of Solo Brands, sat down with McKinsey partner Lisa Harkness to discuss how marketers can use a combination of technology and human insights to fuel growth and customer engagement. The following is an edited transcript of their conversation. Lisa Harkness: How are AI and gen AI playing a transformative role in the future of marketing, especially when it comes to customer experience? Ariel Kelman: If you look at the first wave of predictive AI, marketing was ahead of other parts of business, using machine learning models for things like scoring leads and defining segments.",

To successfully navigate this next phase and meet the Paris Agreement goals, urgent action will be needed and the pace of change must accelerate. The clean energy transition will also need to be balanced with affordability, energy system resiliency, and energy security in an increasingly uncertain macroeconomic environment. The Global Energy Perspective 2024 is intended to serve as a fact base grounded in the best currently available data to help global stakeholders meet decarbonization goals. The report offers a detailed demand outlook for 68 sectors and 78 fuels across a 1.5° pathway, as set out in the Paris Agreement, as well as three bottom-up energy transition scenarios. These scenarios have been redesigned this year to better reflect changing global conditions, including geopolitical shifts, increasingly complex supply chains, and higher inflation. The critical question this research aims to address is how the world can achieve a step change in its efforts toward meeting net-zero goals and avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Successfully navigating the transition away from fossil fuels will require focusing beyond a single solution or technology. There are no silver bullets—the future calls for a holistic transformation of the global energy system by incorporating a range of proven and emerging levers. To do this, considerations beyond technological feasibility will need to be addressed, spanning capital deployment, improving business cases, ensuring economic returns, adjusting regulation, and establishing continued political and public support in the face of competing economic and societal priorities.",

For centuries, philosophers have opined on the nature of control and the challenge of recognizing what’s in one’s power to change. Solving the problem of climate change—that is, achieving net zero in time to spare our planet the worst effects of a warming climate—will likely require all the wisdom (and strategic action) we can collectively muster. To meet this goal, we will need to minimize the emissions directly under our control. But also, we must reduce the emissions that do not result directly from our own activities. These are known as Scope 3 emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions are classified into three categories, or scopes. Organizations divide their emissions into these scopes to help them create effective reduction plans. What are Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions? Get to know and directly engage with senior McKinsey experts on emissions. Andrea Del Miglio is a senior partner in McKinsey’s Milan office; Fernando Perez is a senior partner in the Miami office; Jukka Maksimainen is a senior partner in the Helsinki office; Lucy Pérez is a senior partner in the Boston office; Mark Patel is a senior partner in the Bay Area office; Michel Van Hoey is a senior partner in the Luxembourg office; and Peter Spiller is a partner in the Frankfurt office. Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions are relatively straightforward. Scope 1 emissions are greenhouse gases that an organization emits from sources it owns or controls directly. In the case of an airplane manufacturer, this could include the emissions associated with fuel combustion in the planes it produces or the boiler or furnace in one of its corporate offices.",

Composed of metal ions and organic molecules, MOFs form a highly porous 3D-networked structure in which the pores can be “tuned” to capture, interact with, or release a variety of targets. Companies across industries are exploring using MOFs in applications such as storing gases (for instance, carbon emissions), separating chemicals, delivering drugs to the body, and protecting against hazardous chemicals, including chemical weapons. Despite the Chemical Weapons Convention, an official ban of chemical weapons by the international community, the risk chemical weapons pose still necessitates solutions to mitigate their hazardous and harmful effects. McKinsey associate partner Karl Hujsak sat down with Ben Hernandez, founder and CEO of Numat, to understand more about the potential of this material in chemical defense equipment. Numat, based in Chicago, provides filtration technologies whose MOF-enabled solutions are specifically designed “to reduce the negative impact of chemical products and processes on human health and the environment.” The following is an edited version of their conversation. Karl Hujsak: How would you describe MOFs? Ben Hernandez: MOFs are like nanoscale sponges capable of capturing, holding, and even destroying substances with incredible precision. In my view, they represent the world’s best filtration technology. Integrating MOFs into industrial products and processes has the potential to drive profound improvements in environmental performance and innovation. For example, semiconductor companies are using our MOF platform to effectively remove hazardous gases produced during manufacturing.",

They long to meet friendly locals, eat new foods, stroll through unfamiliar landscapes, and witness (or maybe even join) cultural traditions that remind them that they’ve left home. More and more, experiences have become powerful decision drivers for travelers: the possibility of a life-changing travel moment motivates people to book a trip. The quest for the right type of moment even influences which destinations people will choose. But despite the enduring excitement about experiences and the large pool of value they represent, the travel industry has yet to crack the code on an approach that can simultaneously please travelers, make sense for experience providers, and produce profit at scale for distributors and larger stakeholders. Today’s travelers often find the breadth of available experiences overwhelming, and they crave easy-to-navigate platforms that can sort through experiences and offer seamless, real-time booking anywhere in the world. Experience providers (often small, passionate outfits, sometimes run by a single tour guide) want to create broad awareness of their offerings. But operators can become frustrated when a booking platform’s thumbnail descriptions fail to capture the appeal of a quirky activity—or when an intermediating player fumbles customer relations. Distribution platforms want to become comprehensive sites for one-stop experience shopping but face challenges as they try to scale profitably while cobbling together a fragmented array of experiential offerings. Meanwhile, legacy travel institutions, such as airlines and hotel chains, are still searching for ideal ways to fit magical travel moments into the machinery of complex corporate enterprises.",

To keep pace with the current rate of adoption, the power needs of data centers are expected to grow to about 2.5 times higher than current capacity by the end of the decade, going from between 3 and 4 percent of total US power demand today to between 11 and 12 percent in 2030. Skyrocketing compute and data demands are being further accelerated by gains in computing capabilities alongside reductions in chip efficiency relative to power consumption. For instance, the amount of time central processing units need to double their performance efficiency has increased from every two years to nearly every three years. And providing the more than 50 gigawatts (GW) of additional data center capacity needed in the United States by the end of the decade would require an investment of more than $500 billion in data center infrastructure alone.

In 2023, the sector received $196 billion in federal spending for manufacturing construction, marking a 143 percent increase since before the pandemic in 2019, as the country ramped up production and built new advanced manufacturing facilities. As of April 2024, spending has remained hot, with an additional $32 billion invested—an additional 17 percent increase over the same time last year—boosted by investments such as the $39 billion CHIPS Act. About the authors This article is a collaborative effort by Fernando Perez and Julian Salguero, with Dylan Lambert, Henry Bristol, and Tyler Freeman, representing views from McKinsey’s Operations Practice, in partnership with Kiva Allgood of the World Economic Forum. The increase in spending should help fuel the US manufacturing sector, which accounted for $2.8 trillion in output in 2023.

It has broad applications in commercial products (such as medical devices), in services (such as navigation), and as an enabler of internal processes (such as quality control)—and the technology is already usable. It enables many types of measurements that are currently too difficult to achieve, not precise enough, or simply unfeasible otherwise. Depending on the underlying technology, the size, weight, and power of the sensors enable a variety of use cases in different industries, making further deployment of quantum-computing sensors outside the lab possible. “Quantum sensors are reaching maturity levels that will allow us to run pilots in a wide range of environments and for a wide range of applications,” said Mathieu Munsch, CEO of quantum-sensing start-up Qnami. Most of the remaining hurdles are commercial and related to adoption—such as engineering and creating products, taking those products to market, building a supportive ecosystem, and managing the transition to using new tools. Because of these qualities, decision makers in many industries should have at least some familiarity with quantum sensing. This article provides an overview of the technology’s possible impact on industry as well as a look into the current state of the quantum-sensing ecosystem, highlighting ways companies could think about using the technology. Specifically, corporate stakeholders could investigate the costs and benefits of quantum-sensing use cases for themselves and their industries, set up their organizations to engage with the technology, and seek out partners with whom they could contribute to the quantum-sensing ecosystem. The road to commercialization may be relatively short, so the time to learn about and assess the technology is now.",

Conducted in partnership with LeanIn.Org, this effort is the largest study of women in corporate America. Over the past decade, more than 1,000 companies have participated in the study, and we have surveyed more than 480,000 people about their workplace experiences. For this year’s report, we collected information from 281 participating organizations that collectively employ more than ten million people. At these organizations, we surveyed more than 15,000 employees and more than 280 HR leaders, who shared insights on their policies and practices. The report provides an intersectional look at the specific biases and barriers faced by Asian, Black, Latina, and LGBTQ+ women, as well as women with disabilities. Our tenth-anniversary report analyzes data from the past decade to better understand progress, decline, and stagnation in women’s representation and experiences in the workplace. It also highlights key findings from 2024 and identifies the changes companies can make to chart real progress on the path to parity—which we project is nearly 50 years away. Over the past decade, women have made important gains at every level of the corporate pipeline (especially in senior leadership). Yet progress is surprisingly fragile, especially for women of color, who continue to be underrepresented at every level and who view gender and race as obstacles to their advancement.

Historically, the industry has been driven by economic growth and the development of the middle class, resulting in major demand growth for materials such as steel, aluminum, and coal. While 80 percent of the industry today primarily consists of five materials—steel, coal, gold, copper, and aluminum—the landscape is rapidly changing as a result of the energy transition. Indeed, the energy transition is first and foremost a physical transformation and the key challenges are therefore mostly physical, including the timely availability of materials embedded in low-carbon technologies (as detailed in McKinsey Global Institute’s 2024 report, The hard stuff: Navigating the physical realities of the energy transition). The energy transition is changing the materials landscape in three ways:\n\nIt accelerates demand growth for materials that are embedded in low-carbon technologies as these technologies typically require more embedded materials than their conventional counterparts. For example, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are typically 15 to 20 percent heavier than comparable internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. It triggers a long-term shift of the materials demand profile as low-carbon technologies require a different set of energy transition materials, which is gradually increasing the relative importance of these materials in the overall metals and mining portfolio. It drives a long-term reduction of thermal coal in the energy system, currently the second largest material in metals and mining measured by revenue (2023). Key materials for the energy transition are crucial to achieve decarbonization in the global energy system—and a lack of sufficient and affordable supply would therefore risk hindering the at-speed deployment of crucial low-carbon technologies.",

Lawrence Fung: Neurodiversity is really a concept that regards people with differences in their brain function and behavioral traits as part of a normal variation of the human population. When we are talking about neurodiverse conditions, then we are talking about conditions like autism, dyslexia, ADHD [attention deficit hyperactivity disorder], and even Tourette’s syndrome, other neurologic conditions like epilepsy, and psychiatric conditions like bipolar disorder. Lucia Rahilly: How many people are considered neurodivergent in the population overall? Lawrence Fung: Overall, we would say about 20 percent or so.

The traditional truck ownership model of combining purchasing or leasing with selected add-on services is a proven model for both OEMs and customers. Large-fleet customers have a strong understanding of vehicle life cycles, including the expected residual value when vehicles leave their fleets. They know how to arrange for emergency engine repairs and are on a first-name basis with aftermarket agents. However, the shift to zero-emission (ZE) trucks—driven by regulatory requirements, long-term total-cost-of-ownership (TCO) benefits, and end-customer demand for greener products—will necessitate new business models for OEMs and other truck ecosystem participants. The transition is approaching now—EU regulators, for example, are calling for 45 percent reductions in road transport CO 2 emissions in 2030 compared to 2019. To reach regulatory decarbonization targets, 15 to 20 percent of new medium- and heavy-duty truck sales globally will have to be ZE by 2030. This profound shift will affect sources of growth and profits across the commercial vehicle ecosystem. Nearly half of industry profits in 2030 will come from opportunities beyond vehicle and aftermarket sales that do not exist today, McKinsey analysis suggests. OEMs can position themselves to capture this value by focusing on business models that encourage ZE adoption and improve margins. Although service bundles and solutions are already well established in the commercial vehicle ecosystem, the shift to ZE truck fleets (and, eventually, autonomous trucks) propels OEMs to offer a next-generation “truck as a service” (TaaS) business model. However, capturing this value can be risky for OEMs. Already, we have seen some OEMs lose market share because they have not offered the mix of services needed by their customers in different segments or have not priced them correctly.",

How to assess organizational health The Organizational Health Index (OHI) is a diagnostic that measures critical elements of a high-performing culture in an organization. The index draws from a proprietary database of more than eight million respondents from more than 2,500 organizations across a range of geographies and industries. The index aggregates employees’ and managers’ views on the management practices and employee experiences that inform an organization’s performance across nine dimensions or outcomes. An overall score is assigned so companies can see how they compare with others in the database. The result is a detailed view of the health of an organization (exhibit). The insights presented in this article are based on OHI surveys deployed in two time periods: From 2014 to 2018, 982 surveys were deployed globally across sectors, including 11 surveys with 85,784 respondents at North American organizations in the care delivery sector. From 2019 to 2023, 712 surveys were deployed globally across sectors, including five surveys with 48,250 respondents at North American organizations in the care delivery sector.

When I first started working on this, economist Bob Solow asked me to look at the productivity paradox of some amazing technologies in the ’80s, since computers weren’t translating into real productivity gains. One of the things we learned was that awesome technology alone is not enough. What you really need is to update your business processes, reskill your workforce, and sometimes even change your business models and organization in a big way.

Adopting these fuels marks a positive step toward sustainable commercial mobility but represents only an intermediate step toward zero-emission mobility in the commercial sector. Meanwhile, true zero-emission mobility in the form of electric or hydrogen-based trucking appears to be stuck in traffic as massive challenges delay adoption. About the authors This article is a collaborative effort by Anders Suneson, Anna Herlt, and Malte Hans, with Christian Begon and Henrik Becker, representing views from McKinsey’s Automotive & Assembly Practice and the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility. The transition to zero-emission trucks involves more than just replacing a powertrain. Disruptions will occur across the ecosystem: OEMs are devoting substantial development, production, and sales resources to developing new powertrains and higher degrees of digitization. A multibillion-dollar infrastructure challenge is on the horizon, and utility companies face a wave of new demand on their grids. In addition to those supply-side issues, fleets hesitate to commit to the transition in the face of challenges ranging from stretched capital expenditure budgets to unwieldy business cases to operational hurdles. Hitting regulatory targets: What would it take? The transition to zero-emission powertrains is largely driven by regulatory interventions and supported by decarbonization efforts across industries. Medium- and heavy-duty trucks (MHDTs) must become emission-free to decarbonize the transportation sector in line with long-term targets. To make this shift happen, regulators in the European Union and North America are following a two-pronged approach: first, they are pushing truck OEMs to decarbonize their product portfolios, and second, they are creating subsidy programs to bridge gaps in total cost of ownership (TCO) and ease capital expenditure burdens in infrastructure deployment.",

But McKinsey senior partner Ramesh Srinivasan, senior partner emeritus Hans-Werner Kaas, and coauthors of their new book, The Journey of Leadership: How CEOs Can Learn to Lead from the Inside Out, say CEOs must weave in a layer of soft skills like self-awareness, humility, and compassion to inspire their workforce. On this episode of The McKinsey Podcast, Srinivasan and Kaas speak with editorial director Roberta Fusaro about taking on the challenge of reinvention for the greater good of the company. This transcript has been edited for clarity and length. The McKinsey Podcast is cohosted by Roberta Fusaro and Lucia Rahilly. Leader, know thyself\n\nRoberta Fusaro: You and your coauthors just released a new book, The Journey of Leadership: How CEOs Can Learn to Lead from the Inside Out. Put simply, what is inside-out leadership? Ramesh Srinivasan: The world is changing rapidly. The geopolitics have become quite complex, technology is having a huge impact, and climate change is here to stay. In this context, we felt the world needed a new paradigm of leadership. We call it human-centric leadership. Our belief is that leaders need to reflect on their purpose, who they are, how they show up in the world, and how they can inspire their teams and the institutions they’re leading. Hans-Werner Kaas: Human-centric leadership provides the permanent guidepost for leaders of all backgrounds and levels. That guidepost, plus the actions leaders take to get to it, is central for colleagues and external stakeholders to look up to. Want to subscribe to The McKinsey Podcast?",

Expectations are high. A recent McKinsey Global Survey found that 65 percent of companies across sizes, geographies, and industries now use gen AI regularly, twice as many as last year. Investment in gen AI continues to rise amid the belief that early gains seen by high performers are a harbinger of cost decreases and profits to come. But most companies have not yet seen significant impact from gen AI. About the authors This article is a collaborative effort by Alex Singla, Asin Tavakoli, Holger Harreis, Kayvaun Rowshankish, and Klemens Hjartar, with Gaspard Fouilland and Olivier Fournier, representing views from McKinsey Technology and QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey. To keep up with the competitive pace of innovation, data executives at most organizations have drafted gen AI strategies. Not all companies have moved past the pilot stage, but most have made steps to integrate AI into their tech stacks at some level. Yet a technical integration model is only part of what is necessary to generate lasting value from gen AI. Companies must also create gen AI operating models to ensure their technology implementations deliver measurable business results. An operating model is a familiar structure in most large organizations. A company’s operating model is a plan that outlines how people, processes, and technology will be deployed to provide value to customers and stakeholders. It can encompass financial structures, partnerships, and product road maps to meet the company’s long-term goals.",

With roughly 1,400 properties in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, the company’s portfolio serves a large and growing aging population. Among its assets are senior housing communities, outpatient medical buildings, research centers, and healthcare facilities. In 2022, Ventas took a bold step toward its sustainability goals: it committed to net-zero operational carbon emissions (Scopes 1 and 2), which it expects to achieve by 2040. Ventas used an innovative approach to generate net-zero road maps for all properties within the company’s operational control. Leveraging the power of AI (specifically, a form of advanced machine learning) and physics-based modeling, it derived nearly 800 building-level plans. These road maps are intended to guide building operators through specific steps for each of the next 17 years and include estimated costs and operational cost savings from energy reduction. Even without factoring in marketing and environmental benefits from the property enhancements, estimated operational savings from energy efficiency are expected to largely offset implementation costs. McKinsey’s Brodie Boland sat down with Kelly Meissner, vice president, corporate ESG and sustainability, at Ventas, to talk about why the company set this goal, how it created plans for each building, and what it will take to achieve full implementation. This interview has been edited for clarity and length. Brodie Boland: In March of 2022, Ventas announced its commitment to achieve net-zero operational carbon emissions by 2040, exceeding its prior goal to decrease absolute carbon emissions by 30 percent by 2030.",

Fueled by rapid integration of digital technologies, sellers continue to invest, innovate, and experiment with how they present their offerings. Their B2B customers are shifting toward consumer-like purchasing behavior. They’re also demanding a much more sophisticated buying experience and are willing to walk away if they don’t get it. In this ever-evolving environment, B2B decision makers are asking how they should continue to balance self-service (where they can manage buying on their own through a digital interface) and human interactions in their approach to sales. To find answers, we recently conducted our 2024 B2B Pulse Survey to better understand their priorities, expectations, and behaviors. We gathered responses from nearly 4,000 B2B decision makers across 34 sectors in eight major industries from 13 different countries. This year marks the ninth time that we have fielded this survey; since 2016, we have gathered insights from approximately 30,000 respondents globally. This year’s research shows that trends we’ve been tracking over the past several years have now crystallized into five fundamental truths about success in B2B sales and how these truths are experienced across three different archetypes of decision makers: adapters, innovators, and seekers. The “rule of thirds” rules all. At any given stage of the buying journey, one-third of customers hope for in-person interactions, one-third want remote communications, and one-third prefer digital self-serve options. The rule of thirds holds true across all geographies, industries, and company sizes, all types of buying occasions from new to repeat purchases, and across high- and low-value purchases.",

In the year since the release of our inaugural state of beauty report, published in collaboration with The Business of Fashion in May 2023, the industry—comprising fragrance, makeup, skin care, and hair care—beat expectations and outperformed other consumer sectors, such as apparel. About the authors This article is a collaborative effort by Kristi Weaver, Megan Lesko Pacchia, and Sara Hudson, with Alexis Wolfer, Amaury Saint Olive, and Andreas Zampouridis, representing views from McKinsey’s Consumer Packaged Goods Practice. But these headline growth figures only tell part of the story. While beauty managed to post double-digit growth last year, much of that was attributable to price increases rather than volume gains. Today, inflation is cooling in major markets such as the United States, giving beauty players an opportunity to reset and focus on pursuing sustainable growth strategies over the next several years. Where and how do we expect the global beauty market to grow? Based on our analysis, expert interviews, and proprietary consumer research, we outline the beauty sector’s performance in 2023, our forecasts through 2028, and what these forecasts mean for beauty executives. A closer look at regional growth\n\nThe beauty market’s 10 percent growth in 2023 exceeded industry forecasts across nearly all regions (Exhibit 1). 1\n\nThe Asia–Pacific region, excluding China and Australia, remained the largest region by retail sales in 2023, growing at a 10 percent rate over the previous year. India, which also grew at a 10 percent rate year over year, was a bright spot in the region (with 4 percent volume growth and 6 percent price growth).",

Companies want their chief information officers (CIOs), chief technology officers (CTOs), and chief digital and information officers (CDIOs) to deliver on the often-elusive goal of turning the promise of tech into real value. To meet this goal, tech officers are adjusting to ensure that their organizations benefit from the trends that are reshaping businesses around the world. This moment serves as a step-up. What’s needed now is clarity on where and how tech leaders should focus their energies and build up their capabilities. In-depth conversations with dozens of board members, CEOs, investors, and tech leaders over the past few months, as well as a comprehensive analysis of recent research, have revealed a set of shifts that tech leaders can make to meet the demands of business leaders. We’ve organized them into four types of roles:\n\nOrchestrator: leading digital and AI across IT and business, with accountability for value. Tech-driven growth requires much more than just tech. Tech officers need to move from supporting business leaders to shaping how their companies generate value, directing business and tech teams, and taking on real P&L accountability for business outcomes. Builder: creating new digital- and AI-first businesses that generate revenue. Producing tech-driven revenue requires a shift from enabling business partners to building new products and businesses that create new value. Tech officers need to develop capabilities—including in generative AI (gen AI)—to shape new markets, build customer-facing products, and scale digital go-to-market capabilities that build on a company’s unique advantages.",

In this episode of McKinsey Talks Operations, host Daphne Luchtenberg is joined by McKinsey partners Abhilash Sridharan and Malcolm Gomes, Debasis Panda of TransUnion, and Pravin Goel of BlackRock to discuss how GCCs are evolving to become central to enterprise innovation and strategic success. How can enterprises ensure that their GCCs build the talent they need and capture the value of new technologies? The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Daphne Luchtenberg: A recent episode of our sister podcast Future of Asia examined how GCCs are evolving to the next generation, becoming an increasingly critical catalyst for productivity and innovation for the global enterprises they serve. Today we’re taking a closer look at how that change is being achieved, with a focus on two areas. First you’ll hear from McKinsey partner Abhilash Sridharan, discussing the talent supply chain at GCCs. He’s joined by Debasis Panda, head of GCCs for TransUnion, and Pravin Goel, who is the managing director and country head for BlackRock in India. Let’s listen in as Abhilash kicks off this conversation. Abhilash Sridharan: An ideal GCC focused on positioning itself as a talent headquarters for the enterprise can aim to follow what we call the “10/30/50 approach.” What it means is 10 percent of the leaders for the enterprise come from the GCC, 30 percent of the overall employee base resides in the GCC, and 50 percent of the new age skills that the enterprise is building are with the GCCs.",

Many budgets are set well before the respective fiscal year and are typically approved by external stakeholders, such as legislatures, who may not be as well versed in the nuances of a changing portfolio or the need for specific reallocation. In addition, where private sector organizations focus on the ROI of a specific investment, government organizations measure the impact that a specific investment had on stakeholders, constituents, or delivering its mission.\n\nAbout the authors This article is a collaborative effort by Ankur Agrawal, Chris Griggs, and Jonathan Dimson, with Jihye Gyde and Michele Tam, representing views from McKinsey’s Public Sector Practice.\n\nIn the private sector, seasoned investors favor CEOs who dynamically reallocate capital to the businesses and initiatives that create the most value, and better budgeting can drive excess TSR above traditional budgeting peers. Translated to a government context, this could mean an increase in the number of people served or improved capabilities within a specific mission area.\n\nThree actions common in the private sector could potentially make the biggest difference for government organizations looking to improve their resource allocation for the short term and long term: systematically tie the strategy and outcomes to resources, embed budget agility through stage gate reallocation, and proactively engage stakeholders to showcase how resources tie to strategy.\n\nTo read the full article, download the PDF here.",

By the end of this year, the United States is expected to have a shortage of up to 64,000 physicians. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the already substantial burnout among physicians and contributed to an unprecedented departure of physicians from the clinical workforce. Looking ahead, physicians’ desires to step back from clinical care show no signs of abating, with current projections indicating the physician deficit could grow to up to 86,000 by 2036. One reason for the expected shortage is that some 20 percent of clinical physicians are aged 65 years or older, putting organizations in the position to soon lose a substantial number of physicians to retirement. The expanding gap in the physician workforce is particularly consequential given the projected growth in patient demand: the number of people aged 65 and up—an inherently higher-need patient group—is expected to rise to 23 percent of the population, from 17 percent, by 2050. Research methodology To support healthcare organizations in understanding challenges and trends in physician well-being and employment in the United States, McKinsey launched a research effort to gather physician insights on myriad elements of their experience—from employment to changes in clinical practice, value-based care, compensation, and burnout. These surveys are not meant to be a comprehensive or detailed view of all US physician specialties or to predict their actions in the future. Instead, they are meant to provide early insights into physicians’ stated perspectives to help inform healthcare leaders in supporting healthcare providers at large. The most recent survey included 631 physicians and was in the field from June to July 2023.",

UHNW families are expected to account for about 60 percent of the total wealth transfer (Exhibit 1), and many are setting up family offices to facilitate the process. Accordingly, the number of single-family offices in Hong Kong and Singapore, the hubs for such entities in Asia–Pacific, has quadrupled since 2020 to about 4,000 across both jurisdictions. 1\n\nAbout the authors This article is a collaborative effort by Bernhard Kotanko and Joydeep Sengupta, with Anchali Singh, Sarina Deuble, and Vishal Kaushik, representing views from McKinsey’s Financial Services Practice. The growth trend presents a substantial opportunity for banks, insurers, multi-family offices (MFOs), asset managers, and WealthTechs (technology-enabled wealth fintechs that offer low-cost, personalized, automated advice), all of which can offer differentiated services to new and established family offices. Family offices manage a family’s or individual’s financial portfolio, including estate planning, investments, philanthropy, taxes, and more. The employee base varies significantly across the single-family offices, with the largest employing dozens of people. The smallest might have one or two investment specialists, outsourcing to third parties various tasks such as investment management, custody and security services, and family office setup and governance—which can be customized for each family. Banks and MFOs have been at the forefront of serving Asia–Pacific’s wealthy families. However, other types of providers are expanding into the family office space to target the needs of wealthy families in line with consumer demand.",

For a company undergoing transformation, cultivating employee “will” to change the way it operates is critical for success. Organizations that focus on generating this will, along with building critical skills, executing with rigor, and setting a holistic aspiration, are far more likely to outperform peers. Leaders can take three critical steps to get more employees involved and committed to the transformation. First, elevate a core segment of employees to take responsibility for designing and implementing change. Next, build on this strong foundation by empowering a broader group of influencers and managers to amplify transformation-related activities. Finally, make sure transformation sponsors play a critical role in energizing all employees about the change. This step-by-step approach offers valuable insights for leaders embarking on transformations and creates momentum for change programs that are already under way. The three Es: Elevate, empower, energize\n\nTo cultivate employees’ will to transform, companies should focus on three actions (Exhibit 1). 1\n\nElevate a strong core of employees across levels to lead the transformation\n\nPrevious McKinsey research shows that 7 percent of employees need to be involved in initiatives or milestones for the transformation to generate positive total shareholder returns (TSR). However, in most organizations, only 2 percent of employees are involved. Companies that aim much higher—involving 21 to 30 percent of employees in key transformation roles—see the highest TSR. So how can organizations encourage more employees to take a formal role in transformations? We examined more than 40 organizations undergoing transformations over two years that took part in McKinsey’s Organizational Health Index (OHI) survey (see sidebar, “Our methodology”) and identified five management practices that help organizations establish a strong core of initiative and milestone owners and predict the percentage of employees in this key group.",

When it comes to bringing together separate businesses, structures, and cultures, “people make all the difference,” says Lisa Blair Davis, the global head of HR for Johnson & Johnson (J&J) MedTech. Davis has seen and helped drive substantial growth in the healthcare company’s medical-device business in her 25-plus years with J&J. During that time, the organization has acquired companies in a range of critical segments, including electrophysiology, orthopedics, surgery, and vision. Since 2022, it has spent nearly $30 billion to acquire two companies in the cardiovascular space: Abiomed and, most recently, Shockwave Medical. In a recent conversation with McKinsey senior partner Andy West, Davis explores topics relating to talent, retention, and what it takes to produce growth-focused M&A. She explains why she believes that HR leadership needs to be involved in the entire M&A process rather than just stepping in after a deal is done. She also shares her insights on the industry and her approaches to leadership and strategy development. An edited version of the conversation follows. Andy West: Culture and talent are usually at the top of the list of risk factors associated with M&A. You have just done two major deals. How did you get agreement to pursue these growth-focused deals with people, talent, and intellectual property at the center?

Real estate owners and operators that can attract experiential retailers can benefit in multiple ways. Here’s what it takes. Katy McLaughlin: What is experiential retail? Colleen Baum: It’s a format designed to help customers touch and feel and experience products as well as get to know a brand. Experiential formats tend to have far more brand messaging. This type of retail experience is not to be confused with temporary pop-up stores or branded events. Instead, experiential retailers seek long-term leases and aim to become known as destination shopping. It’s a reason to go. Some leading experiential formats have been within sporting goods, where shoppers can try on shoes and play on a basketball court or run on a strip of AstroTurf. Katy McLaughlin: What kind of real estate do experiential retailers look for? Colleen Baum Image of Colleen Baum\n\nColleen Baum: Experiential formats tend to be more capital intensive. To make the return on that capital effective, experiential retailers need to be in higher-traffic locations where they can access everyday shoppers and some tourist traffic to help build brand awareness. Katy McLaughlin: How is the return from experiential retail different from that of traditional stores? Colleen Baum: First, most experiential formats don’t achieve profitability from in-store sales for three to five years, because of the capital intensity. Second, they often boost omnichannel sales. When one specialty retailer opened their first ten locations, they were all experiential. They had a 200 percent increase in omnichannel sales within those catchment areas.",

(Nasdaq: MDLZ) today announced that it has signed an agreement to acquire a significant majority stake in Evirth, a leading manufacturer of cakes and pastries in China, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval. The move represents an important step forward in Mondelēz’s strategy to accelerate growth in the cakes and pastries category – a core focus for the company, alongside chocolate and biscuits. Founded in 2013, Evirth is a leader in frozen-to-chilled cakes and pastries in China, a category currently estimated at US $3 billion, growing at a compound annual growth rate of about 15 percent. Chinese consumers increasingly seek fresh, premium options with innovative and sophisticated taste profiles to meet a growing range of snacking occasions. Mondelēz already has a minority investment in Evirth to develop, manufacture and supply frozen-to-chilled cakes and pastries in China featuring some of its iconic brands, including Oreo and Philadelphia. Evirth is growing rapidly, driven by its strong distribution in club stores across China, as well as its R&D and technical expertise. “We’re excited about the opportunity to accelerate our growth in cakes and pastries through continuous innovation, leveraging our high-value brands to create more premium tastes and formats,” said Dirk Van de Put, Mondelēz Chair and CEO.",

Harris' tax plan, which contains a variety of tax increases, cuts and credits, is based largely on President Biden's budget — though the vice president has offered her own policy ideas since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee. Overall, the Tax Foundation analysis finds a loss of 786,000 full-time equivalent jobs over the long run under Harris' plan when compared to baseline projections, as well as 2% decline in long-run GDP and a 1.2% dip in long-run wages, while bringing in nearly $1.7 trillion in additional tax revenue over the next decade. \"Similar to the president's proposals, we find that it would reduce the long-term growth of the economy, it would reduce American incomes relative to where they would otherwise be, and it would lose, rounding up, close to 800,000 jobs in the long-run,\" Garrett Watson, senior policy analyst and modeling manager at the Tax Foundation, told FOX Business in an interview. POLICY GROUP SAYS HARRIS' SMALL BUSINESS BREAK GETS DROWNED OUT BY OTHER HIGHER TAXES\n\n\"That's mostly from both disincentives for work under her plan and for investment, which produces higher incomes and creates jobs,\" Watson said.

When you break it down among key demographics, Mr. Trump's income numbers are almost 10-times better than Biden's. For example — now, stay with me on these numbers, folks — among Whites, real median income increased $8,910 under Trump, compared to a measly $850 under Biden.

Should that debt materialize, it could risk America's economic standing in the world. \"America’s fiscal outlook is more dangerous and daunting than ever, threatening our economy and the next generation,\" said Michael Peterson, the CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation that advocates for reducing the federal deficit. \"This is not the future any of us want, and it’s no way to run a great nation like ours.\"",

Powell was asked about whether the level of job creation in the economy, which has been a little more than 100,000 on average for the last three months, is alarming and if the labor market can continue slowing down through fewer job openings as opposed to job losses. \"On the job creation… it depends on the inflows,\" Powell said. \"So if you're having millions of people come into the labor force, and you're creating 100,000 jobs, you're going to see unemployment go up. So it really depends on what's the trend underlying the volatility of people coming into the country.\" \"We understand there's been quite an influx across the borders , and that has actually been one of the things that's allowed the unemployment [rate] to rise.

Powell explained during the post-meeting press conference that since the Fed's last meeting at the end of July, policymakers have received two employment reports and inflation reports apiece, as well as the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW). \"We've had the two employment reports , July and August.

In a pitch to New York voters ahead of his Long Island rally on Wednesday, the Republican nominee wrote on his Truth Social platform that he would turn the state around, vowing to \"get SALT back, lower your [t]axes, and so much more.\" Before Republicans capped the SALT deduction as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017, taxpayers could freely deduct their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, helping them to offset some of their liability. Many critics argued that the deduction disproportionately benefited wealthy homeowners in states with high taxes, like New York, California and New Jersey. TRUMP'S TAX REFORM WAS ‘ENORMOUSLY SUCCESSFUL’: DOUG HOLTZ-EAKIN\n\nBut there has been a growing chorus of lawmakers who say the cap hurts middle-class homeowners living in regions with steep property taxes.

However, a global workforce also brings a challenge: As some employees are getting up in the morning, others are winding down their workday. “There are many benefits to the individual and the company from embracing work-from-anywhere.”\n\nMismatched working hours makes it difficult for employees to connect, and even a one-hour schedule difference can hurt communication, introduce complexity, and potentially create new gender inequities, according to recent research by Prithwiraj Choudhury, the Lumry Family Associate Professor at Harvard Business School. “There are many benefits to the individual and the company from embracing work-from-anywhere,” Choudhury says. “But there are also challenges—and one of those is that when people are spread out across time zones, communication is affected.”\n\nAs the need for global collaboration accelerates and companies recalibrate their remote and hybrid arrangements, Choudhury and colleagues present the first real-time data on how different time zones affect employees’ ability to communicate in a paper published in Organizational Science in May. The team found that when work schedules clash, real-time communication drops, and some workers feel pressure to shift their work-related conversations to early or late periods of the day when they should be off the clock. Yet talking after hours can be especially tough for some employees, including women with caregiving responsibilities, as well as workers in countries with strict hourly limits, Choudhury says.

But despite the availability of Slack, internal newsletters, and virtual town hall meetings, organizations can still go quiet. One of the most common culprits: Major leadership transitions, according to a recent study of 500 million emails and 80 million meeting invitations. Shortly after a new CEO takes over, uncertainty among employees dampens communication within a company. However, after about five months, internal chatter sharply intensifies as managers start rolling out the leader’s new strategic game plan, according to research by Harvard Business School Professor Raffaella Sadun. “A CEO transition is a major organizational event, and communication inside the company is such an important aspect of that transition.”\n\nSadun and colleagues describe how a CEO’s arrival creates dramatic shifts in internal communication levels in their paper, “Communication Within Firms: Evidence From CEO Turnovers,” published in Management Science. And when corporate communication breaks down, it can lead to confusion and stress, low morale, delayed projects, and lost sales. Case in point: Ron Johnson’s brief but tumultuous tenure from 2011 to 2013 at JCPenney, where messages from top executives were so murky, the retail company was described as a place where “communication goes to die,” the researchers write, leading to rumors and distrust within the firm. “A CEO transition is a major organizational event, and communication inside the company is such an important aspect of that transition,” says Sadun, who provides advice for avoiding communication shutdowns. Sadun, the Charles E. Wilson Professor of Business Administration at HBS, conducted the research with Stephen Michael Impink, an assistant professor of Strategy at HEC Paris, and Andrea Prat, a professor of business at Columbia Business School.",

Climate accounting basics and a dictionary of sorts can help demystify the calculations and voluntary targets that companies need to know now, says Michael Toffel, the Senator John Heinz Professor of Environmental Management at Harvard Business School. Roughly 42 percent of Fortune 500 companies said they’d reached an environmental target or committed to reaching one by 2030, an 11 percent rise from 2021 to 2022, Toffel’s research finds. Several kinds of climate targets have emerged, including terms such as “carbon neutral,” “science based,” “net zero,” “real zero,” and “carbon negative.”\n\nWhile leaders setting climate goals might gravitate toward the term of the moment, their progress in reaching them will soon become more visible to concerned investors, activists, and customers. The European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) requires large publicly-listed companies in Europe to annually disclose their greenhouse gas emissions, starting in 2025. “A growing number of managers need to understand the basic vocabulary of decarbonization.”\n\nAnd the US Securities and Exchange Commission adopted new rules recently that will require major US publicly-listed companies to share on a yearly basis their climate risks and their greenhouse gas emissions, if it survives ongoing legal challenges. These laws and regulations raise the stakes for companies’ climate mitigation efforts by increasing company stakeholders’ ability to track their emissions trends and see who’s meeting and who’s missing their reduction targets. “A growing number of managers need to understand the basic vocabulary of decarbonization, which refers to efforts to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of companies and products,” explains Toffel.",

The end of the affair was nonetheless just the beginning for Stephen Easterbrook, the McDonald’s CEO who went from being hailed as the company’s “savior” by doubling its share price in less than five years to losing his job and getting banned from serving as an executive or director at any other company for five years. This consensual workplace relationship—forbidden under the iconic fast-food chain’s fraternization policy because of potential conflicts of interest—stirred an already brewing scandal about the behemoth’s corporate culture as it collided with the #MeToo movement’s spotlight on sexual relationships and power in the workplace. And as new information about Easterbrook’s romantic relationship with other employees emerged, it became clear to the company’s board that, when it comes to the workplace dalliances of leaders, a kiss is never just a kiss. “A board’s oversight over culture and respect in the workplace has become much more important than it was prior to #MeToo.”\n\nA series of Harvard Business School case studies unfurls the details of this drama as it roiled through the McDonald’s boardroom in 2019, moved to the Delaware Court of Chancery in 2021, and ultimately led to a Securities and Exchange Commission sanction in 2023, which attracted HBS Baker Foundation Professor Lynn S.

But no matter how many employees they hire, lines of code they write, or new content policies they implement, major platforms face an overwhelming task. In the second quarter of 2023 alone, for example, Meta, Facebook’s parent company, took action on 13.6 million pieces of terrorism-related content and 1.1 million posts on organized hate. “Content moderation is simply not a good way to counter information that creates false beliefs.”\n\nA new study suggests that it’s time for platforms to admit defeat when it comes to trying to flag, edit, or block misinformation on their sites. Instead, they should focus on curtailing specific information that can lead to direct harm, such as hate speech or the public sharing of home addresses. “Content moderation is simply not a good way to counter information that creates false beliefs,” says Scott Duke Kominers, the Sarofim-Rock Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School, who coauthored the new analysis. “But it is a very powerful tool for addressing information that enables harm.”\n\nKominers worked with Jesse Shapiro, the George Gund Professor of Economics and Business Administration at Harvard Business School, to study how content moderation works best.

Harvard Business School Senior Associate Dean Matthew Weinzierl’s new research explores the business opportunities hidden among the stars, particularly in data from and through space, but also in tourism, manufacturing, and even space-based resources. “From national security to climate change observation and trying to fix some of the biggest problems on Earth, the space economy is now interwoven in our everyday lives,” says Weinzierl, who is also the Joseph and Jacqueline Elbling Professor of Business Administration. HBS Working Knowledge caught up with Weinzierl to find out what investors should consider in the short term and long term as they think about the future of the space economy. This conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Baskin: What are the highest-growth areas in the space economy? Weinzierl: What’s really interesting about what’s happening in space is the fundamental transformation of how it’s being organized. For a long time, when most people thought about what we do in space as humans, they thought of it as primarily a government-led activity. They thought of the James Webb telescope, the International Space Station, or the space shuttle. “If you look at the area of space getting the most attention―manufacturing of launch vehicles and satellites―its growth is in fact quite strong.”\n\nWhat’s changed over the past couple decades is that the government-led model, which served us extremely well back in the 1960s, has been revolutionized by bringing in market forces in a way that they never were before.",

Sure, generative AI can summarize the content of an article, identify patterns in data, and produce derivative work—say, a song in the style of Taylor Swift or a poem in the mood of Langston Hughes—but can the technology develop truly innovative ideas? Specifically, Harvard Business School Assistant Professor Jacqueline Ng Lane was determined to find out “how AI handled open-ended problems that haven’t been solved yet—the kind where you need diverse expertise and perspectives to make progress.”\n\nIn a working paper published in the journal Organization Science, Lane and colleagues compare ChatGPT’s creative potential to crowdsourced innovations produced by people. Ultimately, the researchers found that both humans and AI have their strengths—people contribute more novel suggestions while AI creates more practical solutions—yet some of the most promising ideas are the ones people and machines develop together. Lane cowrote the paper with Léonard Bouissioux, assistant professor at the University of Washington’s Foster School of Business; Miaomiao Zhang, an HBS doctoral student, Karim Lakhani, the Dorothy & Michael Hintze Professor of Business Administration at HBS; and Vladimir Jacimovic, CEO and founder of ContinuumLab.ai and executive fellow at HBS. Crowdsourcing people for ‘moonshots’\n\nAny innovation process usually starts with brainstorming, says Lane, whose research has long looked at how creative ideas are produced. “You start with defining the problem, then you generate ideas, then you evaluate them and choose which ones to implement.”\n\n“It’s like a funnel,” she says.",

Marico scaled up its food business by 4 times between FY20-24 and aims to double it again in the next three financial years. The Q1 earnings met expectations. Volume trajectory (up 4 per cent Y-o-Y) was better than expected. New businesses reported good performance. The gross margin was up due to benign raw material costs. Management pointed to market share gains in Parachute, improvement in Saffola volumes, and gradual recovery in value-added hair oil (VAHO). Pricing is expected to turn positive with a 6 per cent hike in Parachute, which should aid revenue growth. Higher copra prices could hit gross margin but operating profit margins may be sustained. Marico’s Q1FY25 consoli­dated revenue grew 6.7 per cent Y-o-Y to Rs 2,640 crore, while operating profit rose 9.1 per cent Y-o-Y to Rs 630 crore. Adjusted net profit grew by 11.5 per cent to Rs 460 crore slightly above expectations. The international business was stable on a constant currency basis.

In a new twist in the ongoing legal dispute involving Baba, Gaurishankar, and the children of their sister Sugandha Hiremath regarding the Kalyani family assets, the Pune court has stepped in to hear the parties. Baba has approached the Pune civil court, seeking to enforce a will of Sulochana dated January 27, 2012, while his brother Gaurishankar has disputed it with a different will dated December 17, 2022, which suggests a different way to distribute their mother's estate. The Indian Succession Act, of 1925 (the Act) provides that a later will revokes an earlier will. A will is to be executed by the executors named in the will after the death of the person making the will (called the testator). \"However, interpreting this provision, the Supreme Court of India seems to have taken contrary views in two separate judgments,\" said Shaishavi Kadakia, Partner, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas. In 2012, the Supreme Court ruled that the execution of a second valid will automatically makes a previous will redundant because the second will represents the last wish of the testator (a person who has made a will or given a legacy), and the latter will doesn't need to carry a specific provision cancelling the earlier will (refer to Mahesh Kumar (Dead) by LRs v.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) bought equities worth Rs 1,153.69 crore on Wednesday, according to exchange data. “The 50 bps rate cut is a bold stance by the US Fed to revitalise their subdued economy, which will in turn open the door for other global central banks, including RBI to kick-start the softer interest rate regime,\" Vijay Bharadia, founder, Wallfort Financial Services Ltd, said.",

Dixon can target roughly 60 per cent of India’s addressable IT hardware market with these contracts. Dixon targets Rs 48,000 crore in revenue from IT hardware under the PLI scheme over the next six years. This implies it hopes to achieve about 17 per cent market share by 2030. Given that the IT PLI regulations need incremental backward integration, this could be return-dilutive over the short term. It will need to continue capex to meet the PLI targets. Even so, on volume increases alone, FY26-27 estimates will be hiked by 3-4 per cent. The addition of HP as a client was expected since Dixon in its Q1FY25 earnings call indicated signing up two new customers. It will need to add one large customer ideally to move into server manufacturing. The revenue impact of signing HP will largely be visible from FY26 onwards. Dixon plans to achieve Rs 48,000 crore in revenue over six years, with a cumulative investment of Rs 250 crore and this implies a 50 times asset turnover by the final year. Dixon’s mobile segment revenue growth remains a key. It is driven by strong Q1FY25 execution for anchor customer Motorola and ramp-up for sign-ups like Realme and Xiaomi. The outlook for H2FY25 continues to be strong driven by the ramp-up of smartphone volumes from the Ismartu acquisition. Dixon is also seeking one more customer in smartphones.

With committed funding and strong research and development (R&D) investments, NSPL is dedicated to addressing the space-based Earth observation needs of Indian stakeholders while building the first private satellite constellation in India. Today, India relies on a limited number of sovereign satellites and expensive foreign satellite imagery that does not meet the evolving national security needs. To address this shortfall, NSPL is undertaking a groundbreaking initiative to establish a private, domestic all-weather low Earth observation satellite constellation, consisting of 40 satellites over the next five to six years. This constellation will offer high-resolution imagery, high revisit times, and an end-to-end turnkey solution for national defence and strategic interests. NSPL will offer this constellation to end users on a leased or user-definable exploitation model. Dignitaries attending the event, including Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari, highlighted the strategic importance of this venture for India’s defence and space sectors. They applauded NSPL for driving self-reliance and technological advancement. “I am proud to see NSPL’s plans to establish India’s first multi-sensor, all-weather, high-revisit Earth observation satellite constellation and related ground stations.",

The broader category, which includes offerings across equity, debt and commodities, has seen a spike in the inflows over the past two months. FoFs typically deploy the pooled capital in one or multiple MF schemes rather than investing directly into equities, debt or commodities. Currently, there are 84 domestic FoFs, with a majority of them being feeder funds of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These FoFs invest in their respective ETFs. However, the space also allows fund houses to offer differentiated offerings like asset allocation or multi-sector products. In July, these schemes collected Rs 478 crore, followed by Rs 1,007 crore in August. Last month’s inflows were the highest since March 2023. During the 15-month period from April 2023 to June 2024, the category saw aggregate outflows of Rs 2,243 crore. Experts say that with the rekindling of investor interest, fund houses may once again start to create differentiated products through the FoF route. Madhu Nair, chief executive officer at Union Asset Management Company (AMC), said the AMC is exploring products in this segment. “Earlier, FoFs were not attractive at the hands of investors. \"With the alignment of FOFs tax structure to two years for long-term capital gains at 12.5 per cent, it may be a strong proposition for long-term investors. \"We are evaluating at launching solution oriented FOFs schemes which may be suitable for investors with different risk profiles and time horizon,” he said.",

Photograph: Athit Perawongmetha/Reuters\n\nWill they get a second innings at the Ford India's Chennai plant is the thought that is going in the minds of a large number of former workers after the recent announcement by Ford Motor Company. The US auto major recently announced its decision to restart production at its Chennai plant. The announcement has come as music to the ears of a large number of former workers at the plant as a majority of them are not properly employed after their severance from Ford India. \"Majority of the workers were in the age band of 35 to 40. While some have found good jobs, a large number of workers have not found a proper job similar to the ones they had at Ford India,\" says A Satish Kumar, a former official of the workers' union. \"Our phones are ringing after Ford announced its decision to restart production at its Chennai plant. Workers are anxious to know the possibility of them getting employed at Ford's Chennai plant,\" says K Selvaraj, former president of the Chennai Ford Employees Union (CFEU). Their hopes hinge on the agreement that was signed in 2022 between CFEU and the Ford India management with a provision that the workers will be given preference in employment if production at the plant is restarted within three years, said an office bearer of the union not wanting to be named for this report. The agreement was signed at time of severance prior to the plant halting car production.",

Photograph: Leonhard Foeger/Reuters\n\nGold imports stood at $4.93 billion in August 2023. On record high imports, Commerce Secretary Sunil Barthwal said that the tariff rates on gold have been reduced drastically so that smuggling and other activities can come down. \"And this is the time when jewellers start stocking for their inventories to be sold in the festival season,\" he told reporters. In the Budget, the government slashed the duty from 15 per cent to 6 per cent. India's gold imports, which have a bearing on the country's current account deficit (CAD), dipped by 4.23 per cent to $12.64 billion during April-July 2024-25. In 2023-24, India's gold imports surged by 30 per cent to $45.54 billion. Switzerland is the largest source of gold imports, with about 40 per cent share, followed by the UAE (over 16 per cent) and South Africa (about 10 per cent). The precious metal accounts for over 5 per cent of the country's total imports. The jump in gold imports pushed the country's trade deficit (difference between imports and exports) to $29.65 billion in August. India is the world's second-biggest gold consumer after China. The imports mainly take care of the demand by the jewellery industry. India recorded a current account surplus of $5.7 billion or 0.6 per cent of GDP in the March quarter. For FY24, the current account deficit narrowed to $23.2 billion or 0.7 per cent of GDP against $67 billion or 2 per cent of GDP in FY23.",

Inflation in July was 2.04 per cent. In August last year, WPI inflation was (-) 0.46 per cent. \"Positive rate of inflation in August 2024 is primarily due to an increase in prices of food articles, processed food products, other manufacturing, manufacture of textiles and manufacture of machinery & equipment etc,\" the Commerce and Industry Ministry said in a statement. Inflation in food items was 3.11 per cent in August against 3.45 per cent in July. This was led by declining prices of vegetables, which dropped 10.01 per cent in August. Inflation in potatoes and onions continued to be high at 77.96 per cent and 65.75 per cent, respectively, in August. Barclays in a note said the slowing in August WPI was driven by a sequential decline in food (vegetable) prices. The continued climb in non-perishable food prices needs to be watched. ICRA senior economist Rahul Agrawal said while Kharif sowing has been healthy so far, the surplus rainfall in the ongoing month can potentially delay the Kharif harvesting and/or impact such yields, even as reasonably healthy reservoir storage at pan-India level is likely to boost the sowing of rabi crops. \"The WPI inflation eased to a four-month low of 1.3 per cent in August 2024, with the fuel and power, core (non-food manufacturing), and crude petroleum and natural gas sub-groups together pulling down the headline WPI print by as much as 70 bps in the month vis-à-vis July 2024,\" Agrawal said.",

The tie-up with Infosys is part of LIC’s “long-drawn” strategy, said a senior executive of India’s biggest insurer, who noted that the IT giant “won the bid to develop the next-generation platform through a request for proposal (RFP) process”. However, the executive did not disclose details of the other bidders. LIC previously received IT support from industry majors such as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Tech Mahindra.

In its 2023-24 annual report, the public sector insurer highlighted that DIVE is already in progress, and it is expected to transform the company’s operations across the value chain — from customer onboarding to claims settlement — and provide a “best-in-class” experience for both sales and customer service. Siddhartha Mohanty, LIC’s managing director and CEO, stated that the corporation’s vision is to evolve into a technology-driven organisation offering comprehensive life insurance solutions.

The hopes are backed by deal wins of above $100 billion as at Q1FY25, up 16.6 per cent year-on-year ( Y-o-Y). Margins seem to have stabilised. There are medium to long-term opportunities in digital transformation (DT), especially in Cloud, cybersecurity, and GenAI. Positive sentiment from possible Fed cuts could accelerate demand. While revenue growth for the companies represented in Nifty IT Index could be at an annual rate of 8.5 per cent over FY24-27, EPS growth may rise to 17.5 per cent over the same period, according to a report by Nirmal Bang Research. This is due to margin expansion, pyramid rationalisation, reduced subcontractor expenses, higher utilisation, and organisational changes, including CEO replacements. On the macroeconomic front, a 50-75 basis points Fed rate cut in calendar year 2024 (CY24) could improve client sentiment. Early signs of recovery are visible in the banking financial services and insurance or the BFSI sector. Hyperscaler revenues are also picking up faster. GenAI adoption may drive the next phase of growth in digital transformation. The Nifty IT growth rate over FY19-22 was at 10 per cent for revenues and 12.3 per cent for EPS vs 5.5 per cent for revenues and 9 per cent for estimated EPS growth over FY22-25E.

It's not just about affording it, but whether the return on investment is worth it—something that used to be key when evaluating education.\" Another user thinks Indians are overly focused on \"getting a fancy degree,\" which is why \"spending more than half of one's net worth has become common.\"",

The Fed lowered its interest rate for the first time in four years to 4.75-5% amid a cooling labour market and easing inflation rates.\n\nThe Fed is also expected to systematically cut rates to about 250 bps till 2026.\n\nWith this move, the India currency has appreciated with respect to the US Dollar to about Rs 83.69.\n\nTalking to BT about the impact on Indian economy, experts said that RBI monetary policy will be a function of domestic inflation. Dharmakirti Joshi, Chief Economist at CRISIL said, “Even though RBI monetary policy is dependent on US Fed Reserve, a lot will depend on CPI rates. Once CPI rates are in check only then can we see RBI going ahead with any rate cuts. The situation will be clear after monsoon season ends.” He also said that currency rate will have impact the export income and excess appreciation of currency can dent export incomes.\n\nMadan Sabnavis, Chief Economist, Bank of Baroda said that rate cuts didn’t come as a big surprise to the Indian markets and some effect was seen on the currency rates and a minor effect on bond yields. He also assured that RBI’s policy will be majorly dependent on the domestic factors like CPI and US Fed will majorly impact the currency rates.\n\nSpeaking about the long-term growth of the economy, Joshi said that the Indian economy is likely to be growing and a rise in per capita income is also expected as GDP increases and population growth plateaus.\n\nSabnavis added that the per capita income will grow when employment opportunities are created in organised sectors and focus is given to the quality of growth.\n\nVG",

High income, urban Indians, often living in elite addresses and gated societies are often not cooperating in surveys and declining to provide information. This lack of cooperation is a major stumbling block, which distorts the statistical sample for conducting household surveys and in turn impacts policymaking and decisions. “Decision making needs to be data based. Policy needs to be evidence based, and if we don’t have the correct data, if we don’t have the right evidence then perhaps the policies or the decisions that are taken may also reflect the skewed data. Household surveys form a very important part of the data that is collected,” said Saurabh Garg, Secretary Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation on Friday at a brainstorming session on the issue, which was organised by the NSSO and MoSPI. It was also attended by top officials of the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) and representatives from Residents Welfare Associations (RWAs) and gated societies. He noted that there are several concerns about data privacy when it comes to providing information to field officers of the NSSO but underlined that this data remains anonymous. He also said that the ministry is undertaking a number of reforms to ensure that there is no survey fatigue in terms of the time taken for these interviews. “There are a number of reforms that we are undertaking in the ministry of statistics, and some of them include how to ensure that there is no fatigue in terms of the survey time,” he said, adding that this is being done by breaking the data collection into one or two sessions, using technology for computer-aided personal interviews instead of paper-based surveys and improving representativeness of these surveys.",

A new report by economic think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) says this is incorrect, pointing out that several countries impose high tariffs on various products to protect their domestic industry. “While India needs serious tariff reforms, the label of ‘Tariff King’ does not hold up when compared to the tariff practices of the USA and other major economies,” said the report, which has analysed import duties levied by India and the US. It has suggested that the US should consider signing a free trade agreement with India if it is keen on zero tariffs but has noted that the US has had a cautious approach even in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, where no tariff cuts were included. “India has already removed tariffs on most imports from its FTA partners like ASEAN, Japan, and South Korea, showing its openness to free trade. However, despite India's willingness, the U.S. has been reluctant to reduce tariffs through FTAs,” said the report by Ajay Srivastava, Founder, GTRI. Former US President and Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump had recently called India \"an abuser\" of import tariffs, a claim that echoed his October 2020 statement labelling India the ‘Tariff King’. The report conceded that while it is true that India imposes high duties on select products, it said that Trump’s argument overlooks essential context, making his accusations unfair. “Trump does not talk about average tariffs but singles out products with the highest tariffs charged by India,” it said.",

After releasing a hit single, Country Grammar, St. Louis native Nelly gathered his friends, formed a group, the St. Lunatics, and recorded music. Now, his former group members are suing him, accusing him of not rightfully compensating them for the work that the group did with him. According to Billboard, the former group members filed a lawsuit against Cornell Hayes, AKA Nelly, stating that he left them out of proper crediting as well as royalty payments for the album that they did together. The lawsuit was filed in Manhattan federal court on Sept. 18. The album they are referring to is Free City, which was released a year after the success of Nelly’s hit single, Country Grammar. After being assured by Nelly that they would be properly compensated and credited for their work, it wasn’t an issue at the time. Yet, they felt “manipulated” as the artist had them thinking that they would be paid for the work done on the album. “Every time plaintiffs confronted defendant Haynes [he] would assure them as ‘friends’ he would never prevent them from receiving the financial success they were entitled to,” the lawsuit reads. “Unfortunately, plaintiffs, reasonably believing that their friend and former band member would never steal credit for writing the original compositions, did not initially pursue any legal remedies.”\n\nThe members of St. Lunatics were Ali (Ali Jones), Murphy Lee (Tohri Harper), Kyjuan (Robert Kyjuan), and City Spud (Lavell Webb).",

In a statement, the agency says the new way will be more efficient. “By offering this online alternative to the traditional paper application process, the Department is embracing digital transformation to offer the most efficient and convenient passport renewal experience possible,” the statement read. “Thanks to increased staffing, technological advancements, and a host of other improvements, the average routine passport is being processed today in roughly one-third the time as at the same point last summer, and well under the advertised six to eight weeks processing times.”\n\nThe public beta version of the new process was released in June 2024 and is available 24/7. However, for now, only adults and those living in a U.S. state or territory will be able to renew their passports online. During the COVID-19 pandemic, staffing shortages led to extensive wait times of up to 18 weeks for passport renewal as demand dropped. In 2023, as travel limitations diminished, the demand increased and further strained the system. It wasn’t until late 2023 that the department announced the processing time was back to normal.

According to People, the embattled hip-hip music producer is locked up at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. Diddy has been placed under suicide watch as a preventative measure as he is reportedly in shock, and his mental state is unclear at the time. The Daily Beast has reported that the prison is known to be dangerous and is understaffed, where there is purportedly a high number of deaths and suicides among the 1,600 people imprisoned there waiting for trial. Attorneys for Diddy had stated in the paperwork they filed for an appeal in hopes of gaining bail that “several courts in this District have recognized that the conditions at Metropolitan Detention Center are not fit for pre-trial detention.”\n\n“Just earlier this summer, an inmate was murdered. At least four inmates have died by suicide there in the past three years.”\n\nPeople reported that Diddy’s attorney, Marc Agnifilo, requested that the “No Way Out” recording artist be transferred to a prison in Essex County in New Jersey.

Williams Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School, where he co-leads the Climate and Sustainability Impact Lab in the Digital Data Design Institute. Two years ago, the CEO of storied car manufacturer BMW found himself facing a quandary. How fast and how much should the company shift its product portfolio toward climate solutions—namely, electric vehicles (EVs)—in the face of regulatory, customer, investor, and employee pressure? To some, the answers are simple: today and 100%. BMW’s CEO, Oliver Zipse, saw the decision as more complicated, bound up with multiple factors. Could BMW deliver an EV with design and performance worthy of the company’s promise to engineer a superior driving experience? Could the company sell such an EV at a price its customers could afford? Would an extended charging network and a sufficiently robust electric grid be developed to serve EV owners? Could BMW secure a steady supply of EV materials and components, amid volatile markets for such commodities as lithium and cobalt? And would an electric BMW represent a genuine climate solution, a model that produces fewer carbon emissions over its life cycle than a comparable gas-powered car? Many of these considerations gave the CEO pause. Several were commercial. It wasn’t clear that BMW customers were ready to hunt for charging stations, put up with lengthy charging times, pay a premium for EVs—or give up the thrill of hearing a gasoline engine growl and roar. Nor could BMW count on being able to source batteries at a reasonable cost. Environmental factors also arose.",

Rather, we removed the effects of other factors—such as industry composition, company size, and geography—that could have explained the differences among groups.

Since it took to the skies in 1932, India’s oldest airline has had a circuitous flight. Founded by J.R.D. Tata, the first Indian to earn a commercial pilot license, the former Tata Airlines was rechristened Air India in 1946, the same year it became a public company. Nationalization followed in 1953, accompanied by a monopoly on domestic air travel that lasted until the early 1990s. In 2021, amid mounting financial losses, came privatization and a homecoming: the US$2.3 billion acquisition by Tata Group. After more than 70 years of government ownership, the task of turning Air India into a modern, competitive business has fallen to Campbell Wilson. The 53-year-old New Zealander joined as CEO shortly after privatization, following a career with Singapore Airlines that included founding Scoot, its low-cost carrier, and serving a stint as group senior vice president of sales and marketing. Two years into Wilson’s tenure, the airline’s reinvention is taking shape. Air India has delivered 2.5 times revenue growth in this period, and revenue at low-cost subsidiary Air India Connect is up almost 1.5 times. A recruitment drive has lowered the average age of non-flying staff by 20 years—without layoffs—and overdue investments being made in aircraft and information technology present an opportunity to leapfrog competitors after years of falling behind. Tata Group has also moved strategically to reshape the competitive landscape by combining its airline holdings, first in the low-cost segment through the merger of AirAsia India into Air India Express, and then in the full-service segment through the proposed merger of Air India with Vistara, its joint venture with Singapore Airlines.",

Whole Foods established animal welfare standards for its related products, and set up the Whole Planet Foundation to fund microloans to entrepreneurs in communities where it sourced products. Of course, it wasn’t all smooth sailing. Mackey’s time as CEO included leadership challenges from activist investors, the board, and even his own father.

Companies such as Solaris, ClearBank, and Stripe, for example, have generated significant revenues in a short space of time by providing banking products to customer-facing banks and neobanks without seeking to market those products directly to end users.\n\nBaaS encourages diversity in banking provision by allowing new companies to rapidly launch products while focusing on their core competencies, such as user experience or customer service.

When veteran railway executive Tracy Robinson became president and CEO of the Canadian National Railway Company (CN Rail) in 2022, after an eight-year stint in the energy sector, she was returning to an industry undergoing a significant transition. Pressure to decarbonize global mobility infrastructure—which creates roughly one-fifth of global emissions—was creating opportunities for less carbon-intensive transport to play a bigger role in overland systems largely dominated by the trucking industry. Rail freight operators, which have historically been strong rivals, had begun to transform their business models by shifting from having a single-operator perspective to embracing a role in a broader transportation ecosystem, in pursuit of both increased market share and a more sustainable method of moving goods globally. Robinson’s priorities at CN, one of North America’s “big six” rail operators, focus on transforming the company’s core relationships and supply lines. CN is one of the companies driving the growth of intermodal networks, in which disparate players in the transportation system, such as railroads, trucks, ships, ports, terminals, and warehouses, collaborate more closely to take goods from the first to the last mile. Robinson spoke to strategy+business from her offices in Montreal about CN’s role in the transformation of the industry.

Just recently, filmmaker and actor Tyler Perry halted a US$800 million expansion of his production studio after seeing a preview of OpenAI’s video generator, Sora. The industry could soon move toward highly personalized content creation, where AI generates content based on individual viewer preferences. Although such customization at scale may present initial challenges, it could fundamentally alter how entertainment is produced and consumed. Marketing services is another area likely to face significant change for many of the same reasons as the entertainment industry. GenAI-powered tools for marketing were among the first generation of GenAI applications available. The market is flooded with young vendors in this space and is likely to see significant consolidation in the coming months as a result. Established incumbents such as Salesforce are increasingly incorporating generative AI into their existing products as well. As in entertainment, video- and music-generation tools will offer significant cost savings for marketing services. Another similarity: the personalization that the cost and speed of generative AI enables is among the use cases offering the most transformational value, and its impact is still nascent. GenAI could even bring about a disintermediation of marketing services due to the leverage it provides to the companies they currently serve. More significant disruption could be on the horizon as the move toward agentic systems, which act autonomously on a user’s or organization’s behalf, accelerates. One example of these signals comes in the form of a startup called Firsthand, which was founded by adtech luminaries who developed some of today’s online advertising platforms. The company is working on developing a system by which advertisers can embed AI agents into third-party content.",

Additionally, rather than the binary on–off approach of today’s digital systems, neurons respond to both the quantity and duration of incoming signals, giving vastly more capacity to process information despite far lower energy needs. “This will both massively reduce IT overhead and give us an important tool for addressing climate change through reduction of energy use,” says Scott Likens, Global AI and Innovation Technology Leader, PwC United States.\n\nThere are hurdles: neuroscientists are still struggling to understand and model even simple animal brains, and memristors are more theory than reality. However, applying neuromorphic principles in both software and hardware has still led to impressive advancements, such as UC Santa Cruz’s SpikeGPT, a neural network that uses 22 times less energy than comparable systems. Neuromorphic systems can also self-improve through evolution, just like living creatures do, with potential for dramatic positive feedback loops in many fields of R&D.\n\n“If a scalable breakthrough can be made, neuromorphic processors will lead to a dizzying number of new applications that we can only begin to speculate about, and at the same time truly integrate AI into our lives,” says Likens. “Something the size of your phone will be able to run tasks that currently require a supercomputer and enable new forms of AI that could see today’s generative AI models seem positively slow and limited in comparison.”",

The steps Vienna took to prepare for extreme rainfall may hold lessons for how other cities can face deluges to come. And yet, considering the onslaught of water, \"we got away quite lightly\", noted a Viennese journalist, referring to reports of an estimated ten lightly injured people, and 15 evacuated houses in the city. \"On the whole, the [city's] ingenious flood management system resisted the masses of water,\" concluded another local journalist. In fact, evidence from previous big floods suggests that a number of protective strategies used by Vienna, and Austria more generally, are proving effective – and offering vital lessons to others battling increasingly extreme weather. \"Austria has really invested in flood management over the past decades, not least because we had two big floods, in 2002 and 2013,\" says Günter Blöschl, a hydrologist and director of the Centre for Water Resource Systems of the Vienna University of Technology, who has helped shape Austria's flood risk management strategy. In Vienna, a flood defence system developed decades ago has played a crucial role in protecting the city, Blöschl explains. \"Vienna's flood defence system is designed to cope with a flood discharge of 14,000 cubic metres per second – that's equivalent to a 5,000-year flood,\" he says.",

But it appears that bad reputation may be undeserved. Chocolate has long had a reputation for causing spots. Is there any truth to it? Or is it just something parents tell their kids to avoid shelling out on sweet treats at the supermarket? In the 1960s, several studies analysed the relationship between chocolate and acne. The biggest study – which only recruited 65 participants – found no relationship between the two. But this study has since been criticised for having numerous design flaws. While chocolate may be off the hook, more recent studies suggest that there could, in fact, be many connections between diet and acne – particularly the Western diet, which is high in saturated fat, sugar and dairy. Acne is a common skin condition where hair follicles in the skin become blocked by oil and dead skin cells, which causes spots to form. Severe or persistent acne from adolescence and adulthood is mostly caused by genetics, says Beibei Du-Harpur, dermatologist and clinical lecturer at Kings College London. This is because our genes determine the size of our skin's sebaceous glands, which produce oil.

Swindale Beck, a stream in Cumbria, in the heart of the UK's Lake District, meanders through fields, farmland and valleys. However, not long ago, the river took a far more linear course. A healthy river should be sinuous, free flowing and replete with wildlife. In Britain, however, 97% of rivers are fragmented by artificial barriers like weirs. Now, there is at least one artificial barrier for every 1.5km of stream in the country. And for centuries rivers have been slowly canalised – or artificially straightened – to stop water from flooding and spilling onto farmland and houses. But removing a river's natural meanders has, in fact, achieved the opposite effect. Instead, it's disrupted the flow of rivers and degraded aquatic habitats, water quality and heightened flood risk. As the poor health of Europe's rivers and streams continues to make news – due to dwindling wildlife, sewage pollution and agricultural runoff – communities are turning towards natural solutions to restore their rivers. RSPB It took a team of diggers three months to put Swindale Beck's wiggles back where they should be (Credit: RSPB)\n\nSome rivers are being restored with natural flood management techniques (NFM), such as leaky woody dams, tree planting and beaver pens. One idea is to add wiggles back into rivers, streams and tributaries.

In our digital age, these rules may have become even more powerful. One day Robert Cialdini was in his university dorm, when he answered the door to another resident who was selling subscriptions to Sports Illustrated magazine. \"I was a starving student; I didn't have a lot of discretionary income,\" Cialdini recalls. \"So I wasn't going to buy his magazine.\" The guy was persistent, however. He told Cialdini that he would be missing out on a unique sale that would only last for that weekend. He emphasised the fact that the top pundits rated the magazine very highly. And he casually mentioned that he'd already sold a lot of subscriptions to the other dormmates. Cialdini soon gave in. When the man had left, he leant back against the door and took stock of what had just happened. \"I thought, 'You spent your money, and it wasn't because of the merits of the thing – it was the way he presented it,'\" Cialdini recalls. \"And I thought, 'Isn't that interesting? Isn't that worth studying?'\" Cialdini's curiosity would lead him to write Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion, published in 1984.

But scientists are still unravelling the baffling lifecycle of the titan arum. I'm in a row of people shuffling along a winding path inside a warm, musty-aired glasshouse. We edge past collections of carnivorous plants and below overhanging rhododendrons, but we're all here to see one thing: a titan arum is in flower. This huge, smelly, otherworldly plant has been capturing people's imaginations and inspiring awe for centuries. It's only since the 1990s that researchers have begun to look at its odd anatomy more in detail, however. I've never seen one before. I turn a corner and spot it there in the next glasshouse: a long, light-yellow spike protruding several metres up from what looks like an enormous, thick crinkly green petal with a pink-purple tip. I brace myself for the infamous smell to hit me – the source of one of its many names, the \"corpse plant\". Different people have different perceptions of the stench, like rotting fish, very smelly socks. To me, it smells like a food bin that's overflowing – Paulina Maciejewska-Daruk\n\nI'm at the Royal Botanic Gardens Edinburgh (RBGE) and, for a few days at least, this titan arum is the star attraction.

New York Governor Kathy Hochul was clear about her opinion of social media earlier this month, speaking at a press conference to announce the signing of two new state laws designed to protect under-18-year-olds from the dangers the online world. The apps are responsible for transforming \"happy-go-lucky kids into teenagers who are depressed\", she said, but according to Hochul, the legislation she signed off on would help. \"Today, we save our children,\" Hochul said. \"Young people across the nation are facing a mental health crisis fuelled by addictive social media feeds.\" Starting in 2025, these new laws could force apps including TikTok and Instagram to send some children back to the earliest days of social media, before content was tailored by users' \"likes\" and tech giants collected data about our interests, moods, habits and more. The Stop Addictive Feeds Exploitation (SAFE) for Kids Act requires social media platforms and app stores seek parental consent before children under 18 use apps with \"addictive feeds\", a groundbreaking attempt to regulate algorithmic recommendations. The SAFE Act will even prevent apps from sending notifications to child or teenage users between midnight and 6am – practically a legal bedtime for devices – and require better age verification to avoid children slipping through undetected. The second law, the New York Child Data Protection Act, limits the information app providers collect about their users.",

Hurricanes can be difficult to forecast. The speed and path of a hurricane depend on a complex interaction between the storm and its own internal circulations, and the Earth's atmosphere. High- and low-pressure systems can alter the speed and path of a hurricane, while the air which the hurricane is embedded in and travelling through is constantly moving and changing. They typically move at a speed of 15 to 20mph (24 to 32km/h), but some linger – causing devastatingly heavy rain and flooding. They can speed up – reaching 60mph (97km/h) and travel in a straight line, or they can wobble and loop. 2024 HURRICANE SEASON As Hurricane Francine slammed the southern US with strong winds and heavy rainfall, communities in Louisiana were hit by flooding, while in Alabama and Mississippi, thousands have been left without electricity. Hurricanes are becoming increasingly unpredictable – and dangerous, due to climate change. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) has urged the public to prepare, warning that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (Noaa's) hurricane prediction for 2024 was \"the most aggressive forecast on record\". Hurricanes also have a right and a left side – in the northern hemisphere, known as a \"dirty\" and \"clean\" side respectively.",

To adapt to more destructive hurricanes, typhoons and tropical cyclones, we need to know how they're changing. Fuelled by heat from ocean waters, hurricanes, typhoons and tropical cyclones are sometimes known as nature's steam engines. As they barrel over the oceans, they turn its heat into brutal kinetic energy that flattens islands and inundates coastal cities, taking months of urgent repair work to heal. Ocean temperatures are now breaking all records, and these \"engines\" are responding accordingly, cutting different paths across the ocean, slowing down, and becoming less predictable and more dangerous. Now there's a race to understand exactly how hurricanes are rewriting the rules and patterns we've seen before, in the hope of learning how we can adapt. A longer season\n\nThere's a distinct seasonal cycle to hurricanes in the Atlantic, with very few or none at all in winter, and a peak in September.

What are they up to? You've probably heard of the microbiome – the hordes of bacteria and other tiny life forms that live in our guts. Well, it turns out those bacteria have viruses that exist in and around them – with important consequences for both them and us. Meet the phageome. There are billions, perhaps even trillions of these viruses, known as bacteriophages (\"bacteria eaters\" in Greek) or just \"phages\" to their friends, inside the human digestive system. Phageome science has skyrocketed recently, says Breck Duerkop, a bacteriologist at the University of Colorado Anschutz School of Medicine, and researchers are struggling to come to grips with their enormous diversity. Researchers suspect that if physicians could harness or target the right phages, they might be able to improve human health. \"There will turn out to be good phages as well as bad phages,\" says Paul Bollyky, an infectious disease physician and researcher at Stanford Medicine. But for now, it's still not clear how many phages occupy the gut – perhaps one for each bacterial cell, or even fewer. There are also bacteria that contain phage genes but aren't actively producing viruses – the bacteria are just living their lives with phage DNA tagging along in their genomes. And there are lots of phages still unidentified. Scientists call these the \"dark matter\" of the phageome. A big part of current phage research is to identify these viruses and their host bacteria.",

Researchers have identified half a dozen animal species that could have passed SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, to people, by reanalysing genomes collected from an animal market in Wuhan, China1. The study establishes the presence of animals and the virus at the market, although it does not confirm whether the animals themselves were infected with the virus. Many of the earliest cases of COVID-19 were linked to the city’s Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, and so it became a focus in the search for the pandemic’s origin. The study, published in Cell today, is the latest in a series of analyses of the market samples. The researchers argue that their reanalysis adds more weight to the market being the site of the first spillover events, in which animals with the virus infected people, sparking the pandemic. This expands on a preliminary analysis on a subset of the China CDC data, which the same team published in March 2023. However, the team’s conclusion differs from the first peer-reviewed analysis of the data, published in Nature2 in April last year, in which a separate team also identified several animals and the virus but concluded the role of the market in the pandemic’s origin was unclear. The search for how the pandemic began has been hugely controversial.

The problem of filling a plane with identical tiles has been so thoroughly explored since antiquity that it’s tempting to suppose that there is nothing left to be discovered about it.

This lizard, native to southwestern Costa Rica and western Panama, can stay underwater for at least 20 minutes to escape predators. Lindsey Swierk at Binghamton University in New York tested whether the air bubbles on the lizards’ snouts actually help to them stay underwater for longer.\n\nSwierk applied a substance to the lizards’ skin that prevented bubble formation. Without air bubbles, the lizards couldn’t stay underwater as long as usual: they surfaced about 30% — or about 67 seconds — sooner than lizards that could form bubbles.\n\nThe author plans to investigate whether the lizards’ bubbles act as a physical gill — similar to those used by certain aquatic insects to extract oxygen from the surrounding water.",

Nature Index 2024 Artificial intelligence\n\nResearch is just one area scrambling to understand the potential impact of AI technologies. In this supplement, we investigate some of the pressing issues it faces, including how AI might be used to evaluate studies and researchers, many of whom worry it will just increase the already heavy burden of assessment. There are also major questions about academia’s role as AI takes hold, especially given that current progress is largely driven by powerful companies with a commercial interest in keeping their research and data secret. Big tech’s grip on AI is vexing governments, too, as shown by the impact that lobbyists are having on emerging consumer regulation. In Nature Index journals, corporate research output is growing — in the United States, the leading country for AI research, it more than doubled from a Share of 51.8 in 2019 to 106.5 in 2021. But it still continues to represent a tiny proportion of total AI Share — just 3.8% in the United States last year — suggesting companies are either publishing the bulk of their research elsewhere or are keeping it under wraps. It is also concerning that the global south, where AI could help accelerate development, is under-represented; South Africa is the only African country in the top 40 nations for AI output, for instance.",

Credit: Animated Healthcare Ltd/Science Photo Library\n\nA repurposed cancer drug eases the frequent nosebleeds and other symptoms of a hereditary disease of the blood vessels1.\n\nThere is no approved therapy specifically for hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), a genetic condition that prevents blood vessels from forming correctly. Among its symptoms are recurrent nosebleeds, anaemia, strokes and heart failure.\n\nSmall studies suggest that thalidomide, a cancer drug notorious for causing fetal abnormalities if taken during pregnancy, might help to ease HHT’s symptoms. To learn whether another cancer drug might offer relief with fewer of thalidomide’s side effects for adults, Hanny Al-Samkari from Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and colleagues gave people with HHT either pomalidomide, which has a chemical structure similar to thalidomide, or a placebo for 24 weeks.\n\nThe team found that participants taking the drug had fewer nosebleeds, better red-blood-cell levels and a higher quality of life than those on the placebo. Side effects included a modest drop in white-blood-cell count in 44% of those taking pomalidomide.\n\nHowever, the drop was reversible, and the authors say that pomalidomide has the potential to be the first approved drug targeting HHT.",

The data were first sliced along the time axis into frequency traces, as exemplified in Extended Data Fig. 1. The number of TLSs in each slice was counted using the Python scipy.signal.find_peaks() method. The number of counted TLSs was then averaged over all timestamps, resulting in a density of 34.4 TLSs per gigahertz. Note that the number of identified TLSs and, therefore, the extracted density depend on the settings of the peak-finding algorithm. In the analysis, the prominence was set to 0.15. Estimating the JJ area\n\nThe actual JJ areas deviated significantly from the designed values. A challenging aspect of dimension targeting arises from the tapering of the bottom-electrode sidewalls (followed by argon milling), which is necessary for good step coverage in the deposition of the top electrode. The process flow presented in this work could be further optimized by, for example, fine-tuning the etching process and making optical proximity corrections to improve targeting of the critical dimension. The JJ analysis described utilizes a ‘best-effort’ area estimate for the JJ. First, an offset on the designed critical dimensions (the widths of the bottom and top electrodes in the junction) was determined from SEM images taken across the wafer, as illustrated in Extended Data Fig. 2a,b. A constant correction of the critical dimensions of the bottom and top electrodes was extracted from a fit to the SEM inspections (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Second, the rounded surface of the bottom electrode, which was due to the argon milling, was accounted for with an approximate formula for the circumference of an ellipse.",

The a priori feasibility of our sustainable alloy synthesis route is governed by the thermodynamic nature of the traditionally separated process steps that we merge here: metal extraction from oxides, atomic-scale mixing amongst the alloying elements and bulk material compaction by diffusion. (Fig. 1a, bottom). Our approach is based on a general thermodynamic design treasure map (Fig. 1b), using the two most important physical parameters involved: solid-state reducibility of oxides in H 2 , as quantified by \\(\\Delta {G}_{{\\rm{oxide}}}-\\Delta {G}_{{{\\rm{H}}}_{2}{\\rm{O}}}\\); and alloying capability, as quantified by the mixing enthalpy between substances (we exemplify Fe–X binary systems in Fig. 1b). Elements in the first and the fourth quadrants (Fe, Ni, Co and Cu) are those that can be fully reduced from their oxides at the solid state by H 2 , and the closer they locate to the ideal mixing line signifies the more preferential substitutional alloying capability with Fe (Fig. 1b). The thermodynamic validity of our design treasure map well aligns with both historical attempts on alloyed powders17 or nano-composite18 fabrication and the more recent literature on H 2 -based direct oxide reduction19,20,21.",

Synthetic coupled reaction-transport processes offer a versatile yet relatively underexplored method to manipulate the spatial attributes of synthetic materials10. Here we introduce an innovative manufacturing approach based on frontal ring-opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) that draws parallels with morphogenic growth and development, enabling the formation of patterned microstructures within polymeric materials. Frontal polymerization is a thermally driven reaction-transport process in which a polymerization wave propagates through a monomer, transforming it into a polymer11,12,13. Stable front propagation in a uniform, planar configuration allows for rapid polymeric material production. Disruptions in the system, such as heat loss or variations in the initial composition, can destabilize this planar mode, resulting in pulsating, spinning and aperiodic front propagation11. Nonplanar spin modes have been studied for acrylate-based chemistries10,14,15,16 and are characterized by the presence of one or more localized high-temperature regions, that is, hot spots, which exhibit a helical or zigzag movement pattern dependent on the shape and the size of the reactor geometry17,18. This mode of propagation also introduces non-uniformities in the resulting polymer product19,20. More recently, pulsating and aperiodic front propagation was observed during FROMP of dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) and 1,5-cyclooctadiene (COD) in an open mould21. The unstable front propagation in DCPD led to surface pattern formation with spacing of the order of 10–100 mm, but little change in material properties. Highly chaotic, irregularly shaped patterns with dimensions of the order of 1–3 cm were observed after FROMP of COD in an open mould.",

Beyond the fundamental interest of exploring quantum entanglement in a new setting, this observation demonstrates the potential of using high-energy colliders, such as the LHC, as tools for testing our fundamental understanding of quantum mechanics. Hadron colliders offer a truly relativistic environment and provide a rich variety of fundamental interactions, rarely considered for experiments in quantum information. Relativistic effects are expected to play a critical part in quantum information17 and the measurement described here illustrates the potential for new approaches to explore these effects and other foundational problems in quantum mechanics using colliders. Recently, the heaviest fundamental particle known to exist, the top quark, was proposed as a new laboratory to study quantum entanglement and quantum information18,19. In this Article, the spin correlation between the top quark and antitop quark is used to probe the effects of quantum entanglement, in proton–proton (pp) collision events recorded with the ATLAS detector with a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. Entanglement is observed with a significance of more than five standard deviations for the first time in pairs of quarks. If two particles are entangled, the quantum state of one particle cannot be described independently of the other. The simplest example of an entangled system involves a pair of quantum bits (qubits); pieces of quantum information about two particles in the same quantum state that exist in superposition. The spin quantum number of a fundamental fermion, a particle that can take spin values of ±1/2, is one of the simplest and most fundamental examples of a qubit.",

In the frame of reference of the conductor, the electromagnetic field comprises two components: B 0 and the convective electric field E = −V 0 × B 0 . The convective field results in a potential difference across the conductor, which, in turn, results in induction currents flowing through the conductor (unipolar induction). The magnetic fields associated with the induction currents cancel (or reduce because of finite conductivity) the magnetic field inside the ionosphere (Lenz’s law). Above the ionosphere, the induced fields act on the solar wind plasma by deviating it. Thus, a void called an induced magnetosphere is created. The magnetic pressure of the induced fields balances the dynamical and thermal pressures of the hot magnetosheath plasma. Under nominal conditions, the Parker angle at Mars is about 57° (ref. 2), and the mechanism above operates. However, in some rare cases, the cone angle, which is the angle between the solar wind velocity and the IMF, can be very low, below about 10°. For example, this occurred during approximately 2% of all MAVEN orbits from 2014 to 2019. In this case, the convective electric field responsible for generating the induction currents weakens, or, in other words, the magnetic flux through the conductive ionosphere responsible for the electromotive force significantly reduces, so that the mechanism described above does not operate any more. When the interaction of unmagnetized bodies with the solar wind occurs for very small cone angles so that the convective electric field is very weak, we say that the induced magnetosphere is degenerate.",

The LAD metric (CDD in ETCCDI tables) belongs to the core climate-extreme indices proposed by the ETCCDI51 and is routinely used in IPCC reports and by national drought monitors to assess concurrent and future changes in dryness, and to estimate the early risks associated with reduced water resources and heat extremes52,53. A dry day is defined as a day with total rainfall below 1 mm; the 1 mm threshold is a commonly accepted limit to classify days as dry or wet, and it is routinely used in the global climate-extremes data sets, such as HadEX52,54,55. The LAD calculation accounts for the possibility that dry spells can span across calendar years and assigns the value corresponding to the total LAD to the year in which the dry spell ends. Here, the historical LAD is not allowed to exceed 300 days to exclude hyper-arid regions. The historical LAD conditions are assessed for 1998–2018, which was selected as the common period of availability of seven observational datasets (see the next section). Future LAD climatology is evaluated from climate-model simulations over 2080–2100.

Entanglement has been observed several times1–4 and is key to developments in quantum computing and quantum cryptography. In a paper in Nature, the ATLAS Collaboration5 reports the detection of entanglement between a top quark and its antiparticle, the anti-top quark, at CERN, the European particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland. The observation is not unexpected. Indeed, it would have been a huge surprise to find that the pair wasn’t entangled.

Read the paper: Targeted protein relocalization via protein transport coupling\n\nConventional small-molecule drugs interact with a target protein to alter its activity. However, the activities of many therapeutically relevant proteins cannot be modified using small molecules that simply bind to the protein. In the past few years, many researchers have focused on small molecules that bring such proteins into close proximity with another biomolecule to gain further therapeutic traction. This concept has inspired the development of compounds that exert a biological effect by causing target proteins to be degraded by the cell3,4, by inducing DNA transcription5 or by stabilizing interactions between proteins6, among other mechanisms7. These efforts have been facilitated by linking together pairs of small ligand molecules — one ligand to bind to the target protein, and the other to bind to a biomolecule that has a desired function (Fig. 1). The resulting bifunctional molecules thereby bring the target protein and the biomolecule together.

Fresh insight into how to control this electrodynamic effect could lead to ultracompact magnetic devices. In some magnetic materials, the direction of magnetization traces out tiny whirlpool structures known as skyrmions. These robust magnetic textures exist at room temperature, and they can be manipulated with low energy, which makes them promising candidates for computer memory and logic components. The electrons that conduct electricity through a material interact with these skyrmions, inducing emergent electrodynamic effects that can facilitate their detection and that could lead to innovative ways of exploiting these textures. Writing in Nature, Birch et al.1 report electrical resistance measurements revealing that these effects manifest as three distinct dynamic behaviours in a skyrmion-hosting material — offering a route to precise control of these intriguing structures. Read the paper: Dynamic transition and Galilean relativity of current-driven skyrmions\n\nMagnetic skyrmions were once thought to arise exclusively from an ‘antisymmetric’ interaction, which forces the spins (intrinsic angular moments) of neighbouring electrons to align perpendicular to each other. However, in the past few years, it has emerged that stable skyrmions can also exist in ‘centrosymmetric’ materials2,3, which have a well-defined centre of magnetic symmetry. In these materials, skyrmions are stabilized by magnetic frustration, which results from competing interactions between neighbouring spins. This property means that the skyrmions in centrosymmetric materials are usually ultrasmall, with a diameter of a few nanometres. Skyrmions are most commonly detected by imaging the magnetization configuration directly, or the magnetic field that the textures generate. One complementary technique involves showing that a material hosts the topological Hall effect, a phenomenon that generates an anomalous voltage owing to the interaction between the conduction electrons and the emergent magnetic field.",

He won awards for his work, but as his career progressed, he felt unfulfilled. “I began to think more about how these data could serve a greater purpose beyond commercial use,” says Adekanmbi, who lives in Lagos, Nigeria. “I felt it was time to make a difference.”\n\nIn 2016, Adekanmbi founded Data Science Nigeria, a non-profit group dedicated to bringing AI to sub-Saharan Africa. Since the group’s inception, Adekanmbi and his team have set up more than 100 AI learning clubs hosted by dedicated Data Science Nigeria tutors and volunteers at universities and community centres in 14 African countries, where people can come for weekly or bimonthly lessons in topics ranging from basic data-science literacy to expert-level machine-learning techniques. The group has launched programmes at universities and schools and, in 2020, published the first AI textbook for children in Africa. Nature Index 2024 Artificial intelligence\n\nIn addition to education, Data Science Nigeria collaborates closely with academia, government, non-profit organizations and companies to create practical AI solutions to local challenges. “We try to demonstrate that, even with infrastructural gaps in Africa, we can still deliver the possibility of AI to everyone, everywhere,” Adekanmbi says. “We have the talents and the raw data sets to use AI to improve the quality of lives of people who need it most.”\n\nRecent projects include a multilingual, voice-based chatbot that provides financial guidance to female business owners in Nigeria — for which Adekanmbi won a US$145,000 Global Grand Challenges grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2023.",

Neurons (artist’s illustration) that affect hunger lose their ability to sense insulin when encased by a sticky scaffolding.Credit: KTSDesign/SPL\n\nA build-up of sticky goo that traps neurons in an appetite-control centre in the brain has been implicated in worsening diabetes and obesity, according to research on mice1. The goo also prevents insulin from reaching brain neurons that control hunger. Inhibiting production of the goo led mice to lose weight, experiments found. These findings points to a new driver of metabolic disorders and could help scientists to identify targets for drugs to treat these conditions. These results were published today in Nature. Hunger dial in the brain\n\nMetabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and obesity can develop when the body’s cells become insensitive to insulin, a hormone that regulates blood-sugar levels. Scientists searching for the mechanism that causes this insulin resistance have homed in on a part of the brain called the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, which senses insulin levels and, in response, adjusts energy expenditure and sensations of hunger. As the animals develop insulin resistance, a type of cellular scaffolding, called the extracellular matrix, that holds the hunger neurons in place becomes a disorganized goo. Previously, researchers had noticed that this scaffolding changes when mice are fed a high-fat diet2.

Here, a quantitative, time-resolved model describes the coordinated formation of the mouse embryo and placenta.

Temporal BMP4 effects on mouse embryonic and extraembryonic development. Nature https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07937-5 (2024). The question\n\nAs an embryo begins to form, its first cell-fate decisions establish the foundations for the proper development and well-being of the animal. During the process of gastrulation, the embryo breaks its initial symmetry and the basic body plan is laid out. At the same time, progenitor cells rapidly diversify to form distinct tissues. Embryonic organization thus entails coordinated transformation of this small number of cells, a process that requires each cell to sense, react to and interact with others in a constantly changing environment1. Surprisingly, this complex communication is performed by a small number of signalling pathways acting in close proximity2. We asked how the embryonic cells decode very similar signals to mean different things, on their way to forming the diverse tissues of the complete animal. The solution\n\nThe protein BMP4 is a key mouse developmental morphogen — a signalling molecule that produces growth responses in distant cells according to its concentration. To refine the roles of BMP4 in embryonic development, we developed a general model of how mouse gastrulation happens over time, with continuous and parallel cell differentiation both in the embryo and in its supporting external tissues (the extra-embryonic tissues), such as the placenta.",

A group of bacteria that lives in the human gut has been identified that can consume a nutrient needed by pathogenic bacteria. Membership of the group of microbes that lives in the gut, known as the intestinal microbiota, is remarkably exclusive, with new arrivals usually rejected by a process referred to as colonization resistance. Loss of microbiotal diversity, commonly the result of antibiotic treatment, compromises colonization resistance and enables potentially harmful species, such as the bacterial pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae and other species belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family, to invade the gut and reach high densities1. Re-establishing colonization resistance is therefore an important clinical goal. Writing in Nature, Furuichi et al.2 reveal how a group of bacteria normally resident in the gut (commensal bacteria) can suppress gut colonization by K. pneumoniae through nutrient depletion. Read the paper: Commensal consortia decolonize Enterobacteriaceae via ecological control\n\nFuruichi and colleagues transplanted human faeces into the gut of mice that lacked their own microbes, then introduced K. pneumoniae to identify animals that had been made colonization resistant by the received microbes. On achieving this goal, the team cultivated individual commensal bacterial strains from faecal samples that conferred colonization resistance, and tested them for in vivo suppression of colonization by K. pneumoniae and other Enterobacteriaceae. The investigators demonstrate that administration of a consortium containing 31 distinct strains cultivated from the most-effective faecal sample provided a level of colonization resistance rivalling that of faecal transplantation. Next, using various combinations of the strains, the investigators reduced the consortium’s complexity to 18 strains, which still maintained maximal colonization resistance.",

A region of the brain called the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) is responsible for sensing insulin levels, adjusting food intake and controlling related physiological processes such as burning fat and expending energy. If neurons in the ARC lose sensitivity to insulin, we start to eat more, accumulate fat and develop problems with our metabolic health. Writing in Nature, Beddows et al.1 report that a build-up of a molecular meshwork called the extracellular matrix around neurons stops insulin from reaching its receptor, driving insulin resistance in the brains of obese mice. Freeing neurons from this meshwork restores insulin signalling and drastically reduces body weight. Read the paper: Pathogenic hypothalamic extracellular matrix promotes metabolic disease\n\nNeural extracellular matrix is similar in composition to cartilage2. Dense aggregations of neural extracellular matrix molecules, known as perineuronal nets, shape the excitability and connectivity of inhibitory neurons in the hippocampus and cortex of the brain2, and can even govern how memories are encoded3. The maturation of neurons in the ARC is associated with the formation of perineuronal nets around ‘hunger neurons’, which express the neuropeptide AgRP4. Beddows and colleagues demonstrated that, compared with normal rodents, the formation of perineuronal nets around AgRP neurons was elevated in obese rats and mice that were fed on high-fat, high-sugar diets, and in genetically modified mouse models of metabolic disease. Notably, the expression of major components of perineuronal nets — including proteins carrying chains of sugars called chondroitin sulfates — was increased in obese mice.",

The feat, achieved at CERN, Europe’s particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland, could open the door to further probes of quantum information in particles at high energies. Entanglement has been measured in particles such as electrons and photons for decades, but it is a delicate phenomenon and easiest to measure in low-energy, or ‘quiet’, environments, such as in the ultracold refrigerators that house quantum computers.

Should kids do the same? That question is growing more urgent in the face of mounting evidence that children and adolescents, as well as adults, slim down if they take the latest generation of obesity drugs. Clinical trials1,2 have shown that many adolescents with obesity lose substantial amounts of weight on these drugs, which work by mimicking a natural hormone called glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). The GLP-1 mimics semaglutide, commonly sold as Ozempic and Wegovy, and liraglutide, marketed as Saxenda and Victoza, are approved in the United States and Europe to treat obesity in children as young as 12 years old. Now a trial has produced some of the first data on anti-obesity drugs in even younger children: those aged 6–11 years. The study3 reports that children who were treated with liraglutide showed a decrease in their body mass index (BMI), a measure of obesity. The results were published on 10 September in The New England Journal of Medicine. Nature asked specialists in obesity about the costs and benefits of giving the GLP-1 mimics to youngsters who are still growing and developing. Why test powerful weight-loss drugs on kids? Most kids with obesity become teens with obesity and then adults with obesity. Many young children with severe obesity have “already developed significant health issues”, says physician Sarah Ro, who directs the University of North Carolina Physicians Network Weight Management Program and has served as a consultant to Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer of semaglutide.",

Here, six out of every ten babies with infections caused by multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteria die, often just a few days after being infected. In Bangladesh, a major difficulty in the fight against AMR is the lack of data on which bacteria are infecting whom, on how the various strains respond (or not) to which antibiotics and on how decisions are made about which drugs to use. Stop delaying action on antimicrobial resistance — it is achievable and affordable\n\nBangladesh’s health-care system is unusual in that most people receive treatment in community clinics, diagnostic centres and pharmacies rather than in hospitals.

The problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) — bacteria, fungi or protozoans evolving resistance to antimicrobial substances — is worsening. This month, heads of state are gathering in New York City at the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the issue, among other global challenges. This is the second time that AMR has been featured at a high-level UN meeting. The first one, in 2016, highlighted the importance of the problem, which is associated with nearly five million deaths each year worldwide. Although there has been some progress in the past eight years, such as the development of national action plans by many countries, the pace of change has been slow. I am presenting at the upcoming meeting, and I hope to convince attendees that the next eight years could look very different. Tackling antimicrobial resistance needs a tailored approach — four specialists weigh in\n\nOne of the main factors driving the global rise of AMR is the use of inappropriate or substandard antibiotics. Indeed, people in low- and middle-income countries, which often lack ‘second-line’ antibiotics — more effective, and often more expensive, than those that are the first choice for treatment — are much more likely to die of infections caused by resistant bacteria than are those in high-income nations. A modelling study published in The Lancet in May (which I was involved in) indicates, however, that even a fairly modest global investment — in the range of hundreds of millions of US dollars — to help prevent bacterial infections and improve access to relatively inexpensive antibiotics could avert millions of deaths (J.",

Devised by United Nations secretary-general António Guterres, the meeting aims to bolster global efforts to build a better world. Guterres is visibly frustrated by the glacial progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) — the bold commitments made in 2015 to tackle inequality, poverty, climate change and more by 2030. It is now clear that most of the goals will be missed. The world’s goals to save humanity are hugely ambitious — but they are still the best option\n\nA question on the minds of many delegates, including scientists, will be how the world can do better. One answer is to turn to research — and some of what is needed already exists but lies neglected. As things stand, governments and institutions have tens of thousands of ‘evaluation studies’ that were commissioned to assess whether a policy or programme was completed, whether it worked, how much it cost and what barriers got in the way. Few of the commitments that will emerge from next week’s summit will be more useful than an undertaking by all parties to open their vaults and help researchers to synthesize the best of the available evidence. Governments spend trillions on public services each year. Rigorous, independent evaluations offer a robust way for scientists, policymakers and citizens to learn which policies are worth continuing, which should be modified or expanded and which shelved. Evaluations come in many flavours. Some are impact evaluations, such as randomized controlled trials conducted to measure the success of a programme as it is rolled out — as was the case for an initiative to see whether booster classes improve learning in refugee camps.",

Each time she left the house, she ran through a mental checklist: did she have her pain medications? What was her energy level? Would she be able to make it through the day? Jones, who lives in Grand Prairie, Texas, longed to be free from the constant threat of a severe pain crisis or a stroke. So, in 2020, she opted for the only potential cure at the time: a transplant of blood stem cells from a donor without the disease. She spent six months preparing for the procedure, including weeks of radiation, chemotherapy and a lengthy hospital stay to destroy her own blood stem cells and make room for cells donated by her mother. The procedure cured her sickle-cell disease, and she is grateful. “It’s great to have that pain and anxiety lifted,” she says. “But it’s not the end of the story.”\n\nLess than one month after her transplant, Jones learnt that she had cancer, a known risk of the treatment. Three more rounds of chemotherapy and other treatments drove her cancer into remission, but she still struggles with chronic pain in her back and legs caused by decades of tissue and nerve damage from sickle-cell disease.

Ultimately, measuring this wobble could help crack one of the most pressing mysteries in science: the true nature of dark matter. Scientists believe primordial black holes were created at the beginning of time. These objects are very different from so-called \"astrophysical black holes\" like Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) that sits at the heart of the Milky Way. For instance, while Sgr A* has a mass of around 4.3 million times that of the sun, primordial black holes are hypothesized to be about as massive as an asteroid or small moon, and be vastly smaller than atoms. Some scientists also theorize that conglomerations of these tiny black holes could account for dark matter, the most mysterious \"stuff\" in the universe. Others, however, argue that primordial black holes would have evaporated long ago via the emission of so-called \"Hawking radiation,\" meaning they can't be dark matter suspects in the modern universe. Now, a team of physicists proposes a way of settling the debate: with detailed observations of Mars. The scientists suggest that if primordial black holes do make up dark matter, they should race through the solar system at least once a decade.

And if you think this concept is surprisingly rudimentary, you aren’t alone. “Simply, no one has done this before,” Chaim Goodman-Strauss, a mathematician at the National Museum of Mathematics not affiliated with the work, said of the classification to Nature on September 20. “It’s really amazing how many basic things there are to consider.”\n\n[Related: How to prove the Earth is round.] Experts have understood for thousands of years that specific polygonal shapes such as triangles, squares, and hexagons can arrange to cover a 2D plane without any gaps.

Building on these and other geometry advances, a team led by Gábor Domokos at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics recently began exploring these concepts in more detail. This included a reexamination of “periodic polygonal tilings,” and the concept of what might happen if some corners are rounded. The results, published in the September issue of PNAS Nexus, reveal what Domokos and colleagues describe as soft cells—rounded forms capable of filling a space entirely thanks to specific corners deformed into “cusp shapes.” These cusps feature an internal angle of zero with edges meeting tangentially to fit into other rounded corners.",

Fever-like temperatures shift how certain immune cells behave, ramping up activity in some key infection-fighters and dialing down suppression in regulatory cells by modifying their metabolism, according to a study published September 20 in the journal Science Immunology. The findings offer insight into what’s long been a mysterious biological process, helping to partially explain how fevers fight infection. But the new research may also shed light on the darker side of our immune response. The specific biological pathways that the researchers identified could play a role in the increased cancer risk known to be associated with long-term inflammation. In short: “A little bit of fever is good, but a lot of fever is bad,” says senior study author Jeff Rathmell, a professor of immunobiology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). A fever is a systemic, full-body rise in temperature–usually associated with infection. Inflammation, which involves a more localized rise in body temperature, resulting from injury or illness is also common. Though it’s long-been known that temperature is an important variable in lots of biological processes, the function of heat and exactly what’s happening to our immune system when the proverbial thermostat is turned up is poorly understood, says Rathmell. “Science doesn’t have a good answer,” he says. Generally, it’s been assumed that heat makes the body less welcoming to invading microbes–the pathogens that make us sick, “but it’s really not known,” he adds.",

While Meta and Google are exploring modern geothermal tech and other newer experimental energy sources, Microsoft is stepping back in time. This week, the company signed a 20-year-deal to source energy from the storied Three Mile Island nuclear facility in Pennsylvania, a site once known for the worst reactor accident in US history. If successful, the effort would breathe life back into the iconic symbol of US nuclear power and potentially provide Microsoft with around 800 megawatts of clean-burning energy to help satiate its growing energy appetite. “This agreement is a major milestone in Microsoft’s efforts to help decarbonize the grid in support of our commitment to become carbon negative,” Microsoft VP of Energy Bobby Hollis, said in a statement. Three Mile Island, located around two hours west of Philadelphia, altered the trajectory of US nuclear power adoption 45 years ago. Before sunrise on March 28, 1979, the facility’s Unit 2 reactors partially melted down, releasing some radioactive gas into the air sending the nearby area into a panic. While there were no recorded deaths following the meltdown, the incident dealt lasting damage to the public perception of nuclear energy. Now, many environmental scientists and researchers argue the backlash may have been overblown. Nuclear is considered a clean energy source since it does not create greenhouse gas emissions (though it does create nuclear waste). It’s also more dependable than renewables like solar and wind. That always-on availability is attractive for tech companies like Microsoft that will need all the power they can muster to keep their data center running and properly cooled.",

This source of biodiversity, however, becomes particularly useful after traveling thousands of miles in the atmosphere. Animal and plant life needs iron to thrive, and in much of the Atlantic Ocean, that micronutrient often originates in one of the world’s driest places, the Sahara Desert. But there are many variants of iron with different levels of bioreactivity—the higher the level, the more accessible it is for organisms like phytoplankton to use for photosynthesis and respiration. According to a study published on September 19 in Frontiers in Marine Science, dust plumes traveling from the Sahara Desert towards the US East Coast supply large amounts of iron across the Atlantic, but it’s the journey itself that makes the micronutrient suitable for the most distant organisms and plants. [Related: The mysterious ‘star dune’ in the Sahara is on the move.] “Rather than focusing on the total iron content as previous studies had done, we measured iron that can dissolve easily in the ocean, and which can be accessed by marine organisms for their metabolic pathways,” Jeremy Owens, study co-author and a Florida State University associate professor, said in a statement. “Only a fraction of total iron in sediment is bioavailable, but that fraction could change during transport of the iron away from its original source. We aimed to explore those relationships.”\n\nTo investigate, researchers took drill core samples from the Atlantic seafloor obtained by the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) and measured their total iron levels.",

When the strike ended, actors were awarded new, hard-won protections against AI-generated clones. Since then, California has passed several landmark laws limiting Hollywood’s use of certain generatrice AI use cases. But none of those efforts will outright stop major studios from using generative AI to try and cut costs around new movies and shows. Lionsgate, the studio behind popular films series’ like The Hunger Games and John Wick, recently announced it’s letting a startup mine its catalog works with the goal of creating an AI model capable of creating storyboards and other pre- and post-production work. The deal represents the first of its kind between a studio and an AI maker but it’s unlikely to be the last. AI could save studios ‘millions and millions of dollars’\n\nAs part of its new deal, Lionsgate will let New York-based AI research firm Runway AI create a generative model trained on its corpus of 20,000 titles spanning 27 years. The custom generative AI model will then create “cinematic video” which the companies say will initially be used as inspiration during storyboarding sessions or pre-production meetings. Lionsgate believes these tools will help filmmakers and other creatives “augment their work” to deliver “capital-efficient content creation opportunities.” AI, in other words, could help cobble together more movies and shows with lower investment costs.",

Even after 2,600 years’ worth of tiny shocks, however, researchers couldn’t fully explain how rubbing two objects together causes it. But according to a team at Northwestern University, the mystery is finally solved. As explained in a September 17 study published in the journal Nano Letters, the answer is “surprisingly simple.” It all has to do with little imperfections. “People have tried, but they could not explain experimental results without making assumptions that were not justified or justifiable,” Lawrence Marks, a professor emeritus of materials science and engineering, said on September 18. “We now can… Just having different deformations—and therefore different charges—at the front and back of something sliding leads to current.”\n\nMarks and their colleagues first began exploring static electricity’s properties back in 2019, when they discovered that rubbing two materials against one another bends miniscule variations on each object’s surface. This movement then generated voltages. From there, the team created a new model that relies on the concept known as “elastic shear,” which happens whenever an object resists a sliding force and creates friction in the process. Once the friction builds up on either side of the nanosized deformations, the difference in electrical charges can create a current—and the resultant shock. “We developed a new model that calculates electrical current. The values for the current for a range of different cases were in good agreement with experimental results,” said Marks. Marks notes that while most people associate static electricity with demonstrations such as hair-raising elementary science experiments or touching a doorknob after rubbing your pet’s fur, the electric charge actually exerts a huge influence on the world “in both simple and profound ways.” An everyday example can be seen when a coffee grinder’s charged grains alters the flavor of beans.",

The Horned Serpent does, however, bear a striking resemblance to an animal that once did call the Karoo home–a dicynodont, a prehistoric creature that inhabited the region some 200 million years ago. A new paper published September 18 in PLOS One argues that the painting, which dates to between 1821 and 1835 and was created by the now-extinct /Xan-speaking San people of the region, does indeed depict a dicynodont–and that it’s based on the plentiful dicynodont fossils that can be found in the region. Western scientists didn’t characterize dicynodonts until 1845, at least a decade after the Horned Serpent was painted. Julien Benoit, the paper’s author, explains to Popular Science that the painting is thus doubly significant: “First for the history of science, as [it suggests] the San would have found dicynodonts before western scientists; and second, cultural [significance], as the San would have integrated fossils into their belief system.”\n\nA possible later stone age painting of a dicynodont (Synapsida) from the South African Karoo.

They use a specially-built X-ray telescope to study distant dead stars, collect particles from outer space, and grow crystals that help make new medicines. But they also try experiments that are so simple they could be done with materials you have at home—the only difference is that their home is in microgravity. Microgravity is what makes living aboard the ISS so unique. This phenomenon is often referred to as “zero gravity,” which is actually a misnomer. Gravity is definitely still present and affecting the space station—in fact, it’s the reason the station stays in orbit around Earth! The ISS’s orbit, however, makes it seem like astronauts aren’t subject to gravity while aboard, where they float about in weightlessness and have to use specialized cups to keep the liquid contents from drifting out. This difference in gravity on the ISS affects just about everything you can think of: how the human body works, how liquids move, how plants grow, how food cooks. The ISS is naturally, then, an excellent place to test out the laws of physics and the limits of biology, seeing what’s different in outer space. Charged water particles orbit a knitting needle, showing electrostatic processes in space. Some experiments bring common Earth materials to the station to see how we can adapt to life up there. For example, just like you can grow plants in your garden, NASA astronauts tend to a luggage-sized planter attempting to grow food so they can have fresh veggies in space.",

Formed when the universe was less than half its current age, the pair collectively spewed the energy equivalent of trillions of suns across 23 million light-years of space. Porphyrion, named after a giant from Greek mythology, is a cosmic megastructure that amassed when the universe was only 6.3 billion years old, and spans roughly the same distance of 140 Milky Ways. Astronomers say further studies could provide a window into how galaxies originated during the earliest eras of the universe. The findings, published on September 18 in the journal Nature, also indicate this may be only the “tip of the iceberg” for similar jet discoveries. A snapshot back in time\n\nIncomprehensibly vast distances separate Earth from most of the cosmos, but the celestial lights in the evening sky provide windows into the distant past. Images taken of Porphyrion today are technically snapshots of events that occurred 7.5 billion years ago, relatively speaking. Because of this, astronomers can use this information to expand their knowledge of the early universe’s foundational conditions, and how those influenced the creation of galaxies, stars, and planets. “Astronomers believe that galaxies and their central black holes co-evolve, and one key aspect of this is that jets can spread huge amounts of energy that affect the growth of their host galaxies and other galaxies near them,” George Djorgovski, study co-author and Caltech professor of astronomy and data science, said in a statement. This picture, taken by Europe’s LOFAR (LOw Frequency ARray) radio telescope, shows the longest known pair of black hole jets.",

The elusive and understudied Bryde’s whale makes an even more mysterious noise called “Biotwang.” This whizzing tone using both low and high frequency pings sounds somewhat electronic or mechanical, unlike more melodic songs made by some baleen whales. Now, this strange vocalization has been recorded and is part of a new repository that can help other scientists study whale vocalizations from eight different species. The findings are described in a study published September 18 in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science. [Related: We finally know how baleen whales make noise.] What is Biotwang? Bryde’s whales–pronounced broodus–are found in the central and western North Pacific. They are less well-known than other baleen whales like humpbacks or right whales. “Bryde’s whales are different from other baleen whales in that we think they may feed year round, migrating between low latitudes and mid latitudes, and following their food all over the ocean,” study co-author and NOAA research oceanographer Ann Allen tells Popular Science. Their more complex patterns of movement around the ocean make them difficult for scientists to find. The team recorded several of these sounds in 2014 using autonomous acoustic recordings taken in the Mariana Archipelago near Guam. Biotwang is produced by Bryde’s whales in the Pacific Ocean. This image of a Byrde’s whale was spotted during a NOAA cetacean survey in the Mariana Archipelago in 2015.

These small hippos and dwarf elephants (Palaeoloxodon cypriotes) lived on Cyprus. That is, until paleolithic humans arrived and both species disappeared about 14,000 years ago. Now, an international team of scientists found that the first paleolithic hunter-gatherers may have first driven the hippos and then the elephants to extinction in less than 1,000 years. This new hypothesis refutes some earlier arguments that suggested that a small human population on the island couldn’t have caused these extinctions so quickly. The findings are detailed in a study published September 17 in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B Biological Sciences. [Related: Researchers want to unlock the genetics of the world’s tiniest animals.] Cyprus was home to only these two species of megafauna during the Late Pleistocene. The dwarf elephant was roughly 1,000 pounds, compared to its much larger modern counterparts that can reach up to 12,000 pounds. The dwarf hippo was about 286 pounds, compared to the 9,000 pounds that adult hippos weigh today. Both species disappeared soon after humans arrived roughly 14,000 years ago. Earlier research found that large groups of hundreds to thousands of people may have arrived on Cyprus in two or three main migration events over less than a millennium. The influx of humans had an effect on the megafauna on the island. However, other extinction events have taken place over several thousands of years, so for both species to disappear from the fossil record in such a short amount of time is a paleontological mystery.",

For one lizard species living in the tropical forests of Costa Rica, their unique escape tactic involves a makeshift oxygen tank that allows them to hide underwater nearly as long as the Guinness World Record for a human holding their breath. Researchers previously documented how the semi-aquatic water anole of southern Costa Rica will dive into nearby water when threatened by predators. But the anoles don’t survive to see another day by simply swimming away—they wait beneath the surface while drawing oxygen from a tiny air bubble that expands over their nostrils. According to Lindsey Swierk, an assistant research professor of biological studies at Binghamton University, experts previously weren’t sure if the lizards intentionally leveraged these bubbles, or if they were simply the byproduct of having extremely hydrophobic skin which permits air bubbles to form underwater. “We didn’t know whether there was actually any functional role for this bubble in respiration,” she said in a statement on September 17. “Is it something that lizards do that is just a side effect of their skin’s properties or a respiratory reflex, or is this bubble actually allowing them to stay underwater longer than they would, say, without a bubble?”\n\nThe lizard’s hydrophobic skin allows the air bubbles to form. Credit: Lindsey Swierk\n\nTo determine an answer, Swierk divided a population of water anoles into two groups. Half the lizards were covered in an emollient that kept air from sticking to the skin, thus preventing the creation of any bubbles. The other group served as a control, and were allowed to function as they would in their natural habitat.",

The tool, available in several Watch models starting this week, uses an onboard accelerometer to measure slight wrist movements over time that may be associated with respiratory disturbances while a user is sleeping. The FDA makes clear this feature “is not intended to provide a standalone diagnosis,” or replace a doctor. Still, Apple believes the tool is important, and represents one more way its popular wrist wearable can potentially act “as an intelligent guardian for users’ health.” It’s one of several efforts by Apple to make further inroads into healthcare technology. [ Related: Sleepy and snoring? You may have sleep apnea. ] Millions of people with sleep apnea never receive a diagnosis\n\nSleep apnea is an increasingly common condition where a person temporarily stops breathing while asleep, which can cause blood oxygen levels to drop. This can lead to loud snoring or result in people waking up feeling tired. But that’s just the mild side of the spectrum. When left untreated, sleep apnea has been associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes and has been linked to increased risk for heart disease. Most people never even know they have the condition. The American Medical Association estimates as many as 30 million Americans may experience sleep apnea despite just six million being diagnosed. Worldwide, studies suggest sleep apnea could affect up to one billion people. The popularity and familiarity of the Apple Watch may make it uniquely positioned to serve as a tool to help close that wide diagnosis gap.",

But the bone-like design doesn’t get its resiliency from any new additives, but from its hollowed out shape. In a study published on September 10 in the journal Advanced Materials, researchers at Princeton University showcased how cement paste molded into hollow, tube-like architectures can create building blocks as much as 5.6 times more resistant to cracking or “sudden failure” as standard concrete—a major construction concern. “One of the challenges in engineering brittle construction materials is that they fail in an abrupt, catastrophic fashion,” Shashank Gupta, an engineering PhD candidate and study co-author, said in an accompanying statement on Monday. Their solution is derived from a human femur’s dense outer shell, known as the cortical bone. In this vital layer, numerous elliptical, tubelike parts called osteons are suspended in an organic matrix, which are then surrounded by comparatively weak interfaces, coincidentally also called “cement lines.”\n\nWhenever stress is applied to the bone, these cement lines provide a “microstructurally preferable crack path,” the study authors write, “hence triggering in-plane crack deflection around osteons due to cement line-crack interaction.”\n\n\n\n“One expects the material to become less resistant to cracking when hollow tubes are incorporated,” Reza Moini, an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering and study lead, said in Monday’s announcement. “We learned that by taking advantage of the tube geometry, size, shape, and orientation, we can promote crack-tube interaction to enhance one property without sacrificing another.”\n\n[Related: ‘Zero emission’ electric cement is an ‘absolute miracle.’]\n\nUsing these properties, engineers adapted concrete production models and tested if bioinspired, similarly hollow shapes boosted their strength.",

Simple, standardized nuts and bolts. That may not sound too exciting today, but in 1851, the invention allowed engineers to build the Crystal Palace at previously unimaginable speeds. While the Great Exhibition of 1851 showcased Britain’s most advanced and acclaimed industrial capabilities across a number of exhibits, the five-month-long event’s crown jewel undoubtedly came from architect Joseph Paxton. At over 1,827-feet-long, the Crystal Palace was the world’s largest building at the time, and featured a huge glass roof supported by 3,300 cast iron columns. For nearly 175 years, however, a mystery has left historians puzzled—how was it possible for Paxton’s workers to complete construction in only 190 days? A study published in The International Journal for the History of Engineering & Technology now has solved the mystery. According to John Gardner, a professor of English literature at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU), the Crystal Palace relied on a revolutionary screw thread designed by a man named Joseph Whitmore. Before Whitworth’s standardized concept, every screw and bolt was unique to one another without standardized measurements. This meant that lost screws or broken bolts could easily grind construction projects down to a standstill, at least until someone fashioned new replacements. Given its immense size and complexity, the Crystal Palace alone needed 30,000 nuts and bolts—and yet requiring so many pieces somehow didn’t hinder the building’s construction. “The forms of screw threads used in Crystal Palace buildings have not been recorded in any of the surviving drawings,” Gardner and his co-author Ken Kiss wrote in their paper.",

In this case, whoever was tasked with vampire prevention duties did a thorough job of it. After first beheading the corpse, they then placed the severed head face-down in the grave. Heavy stones were also laid on the torso.",

It has several mudbrick architectural structures that housed soldiers, weapons, and the food that they needed to survive. [Related: Ancient Egyptian scribes suffered bone damage from working long hours in hunched positions.] According to Mohamed Ismail Khaled, secretary general of the Supreme Council for Archaeology, it was a key military base from 1550 to 1070 BCE on the Western War Road. It was built as a fort to protect Egypt’s northwest border from attacks by Libyan tribes and Sea Peoples. This collection of tribes waged war in the Eastern Mediterranean in the Late Bronze Age. The Sea Peoples are held responsible for the destruction of the Hittite empire. However, due to a sudden break in record keeping as a result of these invasions, the exact extent and origin of their deeds remains unknown. Some of the principal evidence for the Sea People is based on Egyptian texts and illustrations, which is considered one sided. Other evidence comes from Hittite sources and archaeological data. Given the very well-supplied nature of the barracks, the soldiers may have been successful in protecting the invasion.",

Some Arctic animals like reindeer have several genetic adaptations to help them thrive there, and one of the region’s top predators is no exception. Scientists are piecing together when polar bears (Ursus maritimus) may have evolved some of the genes that separate them from brown bears (Ursus arctos). New genomic analysis reveals that they may have changed as recently as 70,000 years ago. The findings are detailed in a study published September 15 in the journal BMC Genomics. Polar bears are very closely related to brown bears, but have numerous key adaptations that help them survive in extreme arctic conditions. They have two layers of fur to help them keep warm and dry. The first is a large downy layer that’s located right next to their skin. The other layer is made of longer hairs called guard hairs that act like a raincoat. Their fur’s signature bright white hue helps them camouflage. Polar bears can also digest high amounts of cholesterol from blubber without damaging their hearts. This helps them thrive while eating seals and even some whale species like belugas. [Related: Jackrabbit’s color-changing fur may prepare them for climate change.] Scientists believe that the polar bears and brown bears diverged fairly recently in evolutionary terms–within roughly the past one million years. Just how and when polar bears adapted to the Arctic is still debated. In this study, a team analyzed the genomes of 119 modern polar bears, 135 modern brown bears, and two fossilized polar bears. One of the fossils was the Poolepynten jawbone from the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard that dates back between 130,000 and 100,000 years ago.",

This bright-hot glowing peachy orange didn’t exist until approximately 380,000 years after the birth of the universe, when it finally cooled to a comfortable 3000 Kelvin or 2727 degrees Celsius (4938 degrees Fahrenheit): cosmic tank top weather. Prior to this period, the plasma makeup of the infant universe was too dense for light to travel. That would require low enough temperatures for atoms to form before the universe could hope to produce anything that could be defined as a color.\n\nNowadays the average temperature of the universe sits just below a chilly 3 Kelvin, a steep decline from the primordial 3000 Kelvin. This was deduced from studies of the cosmic background radiation, a blueprint of the universe left behind from the big bang. The early universe had an evenly distributed temperature with wavelengths attributed to a blackbody: an object or thing that exhibits color based only on its temperature rather than the material it is made of. If humans had been able to observe this color as it permeated the space-time of the early universe, it would be similar to a warm orange campfire. That bright orange would slowly darken and fade until the universe was roughly 100 million years old, when the first stars were born, resulting in the universe we recognize today.",

This new species was also discovered hiding “in plain sight.” Mississippi State Ph.D. student and study co-author Logan Moore was collecting infected fruit flies in his backyard in Starkville to learn more about nematode infections in the flies. When studying some of the flies, the team found wasp larvae in their abdomens, but couldn’t tell what species of wasp it was. [Related: This parasitic wasp forces other parasitic wasps to do its dirty work, then eats them.] Typically when a parasitoid wasp lays eggs in fruit fly larvae or pupae, the eggs hatch and young wasps develop in their host as they mature. They eat their host from the inside, ultimately killing their host before it reaches adulthood. Syntretus perlmani dares to be different.",

Each device is nearly 700-feet-wide when fully deployed, and like BlueWalker 3—AST SpaceMobile’s 2022 prototype, also in orbit—every BlueBird will soon shine brighter than most stars and planets in the night sky. But despite the concerns of critics and experts alike, the company’s CEO vows they are “just getting started.”\n\nFounded in 2017, AST SpaceMobile is currently working with AT&T to construct the world’s first space-based cellular broadband network. In a statement on Thursday, AT&T Chief Operating Officer Jeff McElfresh said it’s all part of a plan to offer “a future where our customers will only be hard to reach if they choose to be.” AST SpaceMobile successfully delivered its BlueWalker 3 prototype into low-Earth orbit (LEO) in September 2022, and demonstrated it by allowing a smartphone to make a voice call the following September. Less than a month after the milestone, an international study published in Nature confirmed BlueWalker 3’s peak brightness matched that of Procyon and Achernar, two of the ten brightest stars in the night sky. Subsequent observations recorded even higher magnitudes similar to the stars that make up the constellation of Orion. [Related: Some space junk just got smacked by more space junk, complicating cleanup.] Each of the five BlueBirds now in orbit are roughly the same size as BlueWalker 3, meaning they will soon offer similar experiences for sky observers—sometimes visible even to the naked eye. But to achieve a reliable, high speed, and commercially viable satellite broadband network, AST SpaceMobile says it will need to deploy a constellation of nearly 90 satellites.",

According to a study published on September 13 in Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, “presenteeism” doesn’t ensure continual productivity and profit. If anything, it can make workplaces worse off while cumulatively losing billions of dollars in the process. The research was led by Claire Smith, a University of South Florida assistant professor of psychology, who developed a new, 11-attribute assessment called the Presenteeism Pressure Scale. This survey asked respondents to rate on a scale of 1-to-7 various feelings as they related to their jobs. These included prompts such as:\n\nPeople who use sick or mental health days are looked down on in my organization. I am expected to work even if I’m not feeling well. It is uncommon for employees to take sick or mental health days at my organization. Smith then gathered responses from hundreds of participants spread across four groups taking separate surveys. At her project’s conclusion, Smith found that a chronic expectation to work through illnesses is often far more detrimental to an organization than simply allowing people to stay at home and rest. In one study of 764 workers, for example, many said they participated in presenteeism not only due to their own motivations, but because their place of employment made it feel expected of them. Another sample group of over 800 individuals indicated that such pressures caused them to evaluate their organizations negatively—feelings that often led to less job satisfaction and commitment. Yet another group of 350 volunteers took those feelings a step further.",

The Permian-Triassic warming events killed 80 to 90 percent of species living on Earth and offer a stark warning as the planet continues to warm. This new look at how ocean warming played a major role in this volatile time in Earth’s history is detailed in a study published September 12 in the journal Science. The Great Dying\n\nThe Permian-Triassic mass extinction–also called The Great Dying–was triggered by massive volcanic eruptions in present day Siberia. The volcanoes spewed toxic gasses into the atmosphere and the increased carbon dioxide emissions rapidly increased temperatures around the globe. The Great Dying eventually paved the way for dinosaurs to dominate Earth, but it was even worse than the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction that eventually wiped most of them out about 66 million years ago. The increased carbon dioxide from the volcanoes and UV light radiation caused both marine and land ecosystems to break down. However, what caused plants and famously resilient insects on land to suffer as badly as those in the world’s oceans has remained a scientific mystery. [Related: This tiger-sized, saber-toothed, rhino-skinned predator thrived before the ‘Great Dying.’]\n\n“Climate warming alone cannot drive such devastating extinctions because, as we are seeing today, when the tropics become too hot, species migrate to the cooler, higher latitudes,” study co-author Alexander Farnsworth, a meteorologist and climatologist at the University of Bristol in England, said in a statement. “Our research has revealed that increased greenhouse gasses don’t just make the majority of the planet warmer, they also increase weather and climate variability making it even more ‘wild’ and difficult for life to survive.”\n\nAccording to the team, this catastrophe shows that global warming isn’t just a matter of the planet becoming unbearably hot, but also causes conditions to swing wildly over a period of several decades.",

Podcasters, prominent public figures, and leading political figures have breathed oxygen into once fringe ideas of collusion and deception. People are listening. Nationwide, nearly half of adults surveyed by the polling firm YouGov said they believe there is a secret group of people that control world events. Nearly a third (29%) believe voting machines were manipulated to alter votes in the 2020 presidential election. A surprising amount of Americans think the Earth is flat. Anyone who’s spent time trying to refute those claims to a true believer knows how challenging of a task that can be. But what if a ChatGPT-like large language model could do some of that headache-inducing heavy lifting? A group of researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cornell, and American University put that idea to the test with a custom made chatbot they are now calling “debunkbot.” The researchers, who published their findings in Science, had self-described conspiracy theorists engage in a back-and-forth conversation with a chatbot, which was instructed to produce detailed counter arguments to refute their position and ultimately try to change their minds. In the end, conversations with the chatbot reduced the participant’s overall confidence in their professed conspiracy theory by an average of 20%. Around a quarter of the participants disavowed their conspiracy theory entirely after speaking with the AI. “We see that the AI overwhelmingly was providing non-con conspiratorial explanations for these seemingly conspiratorial events and encouraging people to engage in critical thinking and providing counter evidence,” MIT professor and paper co-author David Rand said during a press briefing.",

According to one astrophysicist, however, there is a possibility that certain events may increase the chance for a catastrophic rendezvous with the roughly 1,210-foot-wide space rock known as 99942 Apophis. And although the odds remain almost comically small, based on the available evidence, humanity certainly doesn’t want the situation to play out as theorized. Apophis is one of the most studied near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) in history—not for any striking physical characteristics, but for its trajectory. Astronomers initially voiced concern about the possibility of a collision with Earth after discovering it in 2004, and put the odds of such a disaster at 2.7-percent. These calculations originally earned Apophis a Level 4 on the Torino impact hazard scale, the highest ever recorded. Soon, however, revised analysis indicated Apophis’ route was still relatively close to the planet, but safely outside any need for worry. By 2006, its Torino level was lowered to 0, where it has remained ever since. In 2021, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory indicated there was no chance of the asteroid hitting Earth within the next 100 years. But as University of Western Ontario’s Paul Wiegert points out in his new study published in The Planetary Science Journal, these conclusions remain ironclad only so long as nothing influences its path. An encounter with another asteroid, even as small as 2-feet-across, may be enough to alter its route. Increase that object’s size to barely 11-feet, and it could bump Apophis enough to make it a problem for humanity when it reaches its closest proximity to Earth on April 13, 2029.",

And no, they’re also definitely not “chemtrails.”\n\nWhat they are, instead, is frozen water vapor crystallized on soot particles, both of which are standard byproducts of a jet’s combustion engine. In brief “a contrail is an artificial cloud,” says Stephen Barrett, an engineering professor at Cambridge University who studies the environmental impacts of aviation. “They’re very much the same as natural cirrus clouds, except they’re initially long and straight,” he tells Popular Science. And though conspiracy theories about airplanes distributing mind control chemicals aren’t correct, contrails are having a negative planetary effect. How do contrails form? Despite being as simple as water vapor and dust, contrails don’t always form or linger in a plane’s wake. Atmospheric conditions have to be just right to enable the jet vapor to crystallize: moist enough that the water doesn’t evaporate, and cool enough that it freezes. “Air that’s cold enough or humid enough is called ice supersaturated,” says Barrett. Compared with other atmospheric elevations, ice supersaturation is relatively common at standard commercial jet cruising altitude (about 35,000 feet up). Yet still, it only happens about five to 10 percent of the time, he adds.",

Also called Latimeria, coelacanths are a deep-sea fish found off eastern Africa and Indonesia today. This new “exceptionally well-preserved” ancient and primitive coelacanth is linked to a period of heightened movement of the Earth’s crust that likely rapidly sped up this fish’s evolution. Ngamugawi wirngarri also helps fill in an important transition between its earliest forms to its more evolved body. The findings are detailed in a study published September 12 in the journal Nature Communications. “Our analyses found that tectonic plate activity had a profound influence on rates of coelacanth evolution,” Alice Clement, a study co-author and evolutionary biologist and palaeontologist from Flinders University in Australia, said in a statement. “Namely that new species of coelacanth were more likely to evolve during periods of heightened tectonic activity as new habitats were divided and created.”\n\n[Related: Our four-legged ancestors evolved from sea to land astonishingly quickly.] What is the Denovian mass extinction?

The remains belong to a man archeologists nicknamed “Thorin” after Thorin Oakenshield, one of the dwarfs from JRR Tolkien’s The Hobbit. This Neanderthal Thorin lived in a small community in the present day Rhône Valley, France. A new genetic analysis revealed that Thorin’s community was isolated from other groups and diverged from more well-studied Neanderthals about 100,000 years ago. The findings are described in a study published September 11 in the Cell Press journal Cell Genomics and could shed light on the reasons behind this species’ extinction. [Related: Neanderthals may have been early risers.] “Until now, the story has been that at the time of the extinction there was just one Neanderthal population that was genetically homogeneous, but now we know that there were at least two populations present at that time,” study co-author and University of Copenhagen population geneticist Tharsika Vimala said in a statement. In 2015, archeologists first uncovered Thorin’s fossilized remains in Grotte Mandrin, a well-studied cave system. Several ancient tools and remains have been uncovered here and the area is still being excavated. Grotte Mandrin also housed early Homo sapiens, but necessarily not at the same time as Neanderthals. “The Thorin population spent 50,000 years without exchanging genes with other Neanderthal populations,” Ludovic Slimak, a study co-author archeologist from France’s Université Toulouse Paul Sabatier who first discovered Thorin, said in a statement. “We thus have 50 millennia during which two Neanderthal populations, living about 10 days’ walk from each other, coexisted while completely ignoring each other.",

The company revealed its plans on September 10, citing hopes to both streamline its operations and make them more sustainable. Japan’s iconic Shinkansen railines, more commonly known as bullet trains, have been a staple of the nation’s high-speed public transportation routes for over half a century. Traveling as fast as 300 km per hour (roughly 186 mph), the trains weave throughout the country’s major urban areas, and are now completely electric as well as more lightweight than earlier models. According to The Japan Times, self-driving bullet trains have been a part of JR East’s overall plans since at least 2018, when the company presented its “Transformation 2027” project framework. [Related: Texas could get a 205-mph bullet train zipping between Houston and Dallas.] The plan for a phased rollout will begin in 2028 with Shinkansen trains upgraded with second degree automation capabilities. “Second degree,” in this case, means the railcar will operate without a human actively directing its routes, although a driver will remain inside the cockpit in case of any emergencies. These second degree trains will travel within a short section of the route connecting Nagaoka Station and the Niigata station center. JR East will then begin testing third degree automation lines—fully driverless with crew performing other duties as needed elsewhere on the trains—on an out-of-service route the following year. From there, the company hopes to complete a fourth grade automation rollout between Tokyo and Niigata on the Joetsu Shinkansen line by the mid-2030s, with other lines to come.",

So it’s not surprising that, while he was at Columbia, he decided to take some insect samples from the most pedestrian location he could find: the Broadway medians at 63rd and 76th streets. As the New York Post reported in 2012, he found a surprising ant on the Upper West Side—it looked similar to many European species, but he couldn’t find an exact match. Some researchers speculated that it might have evolved in the isolation of the concrete jungle.",

Living microscopic bacteria and fungi are moving more than 1,200 miles between locations, traveling on winds about 10,000 feet above the ground, according to research published September 9 in the journal PNAS. The findings could have implications for human health and the continued spread of drug-resistant genes among pathogens around the globe. An unexpected and unsettling number of these microbes circulating far above the surface are potentially disease-causing and some are resistant to multiple antibiotics, according to the analysis. “We were not supposed to find anything like this,” says lead study author Xavier Rodó, a computational ecologist and research professor at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, where he leads the climate and health group. It’s “detection of an unprecedented diversity of microbial taxa at heights [far above the planetary boundary layer],” he adds. From 10 different sampling flights over Japan, Rodó and his colleagues used genetic analysis to identify 266 fungal and 305 bacterial genera, which he says likely represent upwards of 2,000 total species. Based on their assessment of air currents and other trace compounds found in the samples, the researchers determined these microbes originated in agricultural regions of Northeast Asia and were carried about 1,200 miles through the atmosphere into Japanese airspace, where they slowly floated downward towards Earth’s surface. Many of the microbes detected up high, were also found lower down, implying the bacteria and fungi are making it into our immediate environment. “We were not supposed to find anything like this.”\n\nNot all microbes are harmful, but, notably, more than one third of the collected and ID’d organisms in this case were pathogens known to cause human disease in the correct exposure context.",

A recently published paper in Nature Communications discovered that low-frequency, large-scale circulation changes in the Arctic regulate atmospheric river activity and influence moisture regionwide.\n\nIn recent decades, Arctic surface air temperatures have been warming more than twice the global average rate. With more warming comes more atmospheric moisture. This increased moisture has many effects across the ecosystem, such as higher specific humidity, greater cloud cover and water content and more precipitation across the Arctic.\n\nUsing models and recorded atmospheric river observations, the NSF-funded team discovered the key role of large-scale circulation in regulating moisture transportation toward the poles. These large-scale circulations control atmospheric rivers. Atmospheric rivers are long plumes of intense water vapor that move northeastward, typically formed because of the interaction between a cold front, which contains a large amount of water vapor, and a warm front. These sky streams carry over 90% of outside water vapor into the Arctic. As a result, forces such as circulation that influence these atmospheric rivers influence moisture across the area.",

About half of all continental crust consists of cratons, some of Earth's longest-lived and most expansive geologic features.\n\n\"We studied cratons around the world and found that introducing sedimentary rocks, enriched in heat-producing elements, into the global rock cycle caused a significant boost to the energy budget available to drive the stabilization of continents,\" said Andrew Smye, a co-author on the study.\n\nAncient weathering processes concentrated heat-producing elements like uranium, thorium and potassium into sediments on land that were then incorporated into the deep crust, where they melted and underwent chemical processes that stabilized the entire crust.\n\n\"Cratons occur all over the globe and have a similar, but not identical, history.

Credit: Vanderbilt University Medical Center\n\nFever temperatures rev up immune cell metabolism, proliferation and activity, but they also—in a particular subset of T cells—cause mitochondrial stress, DNA damage and cell death, Vanderbilt University Medical Center researchers have discovered. The findings, published in the journal Science Immunology, offer a mechanistic understanding of how cells respond to heat and could explain how chronic inflammation contributes to the development of cancer. The impact of fever temperatures on cells is a relatively understudied area, said Jeff Rathmell, Ph.D., Cornelius Vanderbilt Professor of Immunobiology and corresponding author of the new study. Most of the existing temperature-related research relates to agriculture and how extreme temperatures impact crops and livestock, he noted. It's challenging to change the temperature of animal models without causing stress, and cells in the laboratory are generally cultured in incubators that are set at human body temperature: 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit). \"Standard body temperature is not actually the temperature for most inflammatory processes, but few have really gone to the trouble to see what happens when you change the temperature,\" said Rathmell, who also directs the Vanderbilt Center for Immunobiology. Graduate student Darren Heintzman was interested in the impact of fevers for personal reasons: Before he joined the Rathmell lab, his father developed an autoimmune disease and had a constant fever for months on end.",

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: Unsplash/CC0 Public Domain\n\nOne major reason why it has been difficult to develop an effective HIV vaccine is that the virus mutates very rapidly, allowing it to evade the antibody response generated by vaccines. Several years ago, MIT researchers showed that administering a series of escalating doses of an HIV vaccine over a two-week period could help overcome a part of that challenge by generating larger quantities of neutralizing antibodies. However, a multidose vaccine regimen administered over a short time is not practical for mass vaccination campaigns. In a new study, the researchers have now found that they can achieve a similar immune response with just two doses, given one week apart. The first dose, which is much smaller, prepares the immune system to respond more powerfully to the second, larger dose. This study, which was performed by bringing together computational modeling and experiments in mice, used an HIV envelope protein as the vaccine. A single-dose version of this vaccine is now in clinical trials, and the researchers hope to establish another study group that will receive the vaccine on a two-dose schedule. \"By bringing together the physical and life sciences, we shed light on some basic immunological questions that helped develop this two-dose schedule to mimic the multiple-dose regimen,\" says Arup Chakraborty, the John M. Deutch Institute Professor at MIT and a member of MIT's Institute for Medical Engineering and Science and the Ragon Institute of MIT, MGH and Harvard University. This approach may also generalize to vaccines for other diseases, Chakraborty notes.",

T-cell responses are part of the adaptive immune system, part of the body's \"smart system\" that monitors for threats and fights them with customized defenses. \"Therapies that use the patient's immune system to fight their disease have a lot of potential to change how patients are treated.

Alspach and her team aimed to understand what determines good T-cell responses in patients, why some patients seem to have better T-cell responses than others, and why some patients respond well to immunotherapies. Research findings recently published in Cancer Immunology Research show that a protein called CXCL13 that has recently been linked to immunotherapy response in patients is more highly expressed in females than males. Additionally, Alspach and her team found that CXCL13 expression is a better marker of immunotherapy response in females than in males.

Recurrent wheezing is a serious morbidity, and it is estimated that about one-third of school-age children exhibit this symptom in the first five years of life. Recurrent wheezing in childhood is a significant risk factor for irreversible lung damage in adulthood. Therefore, it is crucial to accurately identify children with this condition at an early age and to enhance the efficacy of treatment and prevention strategies. However, the capacity to diagnose these cases in the preschool period remains constrained. In a study published in the journal Wearable Electronics, a group of researchers from China outlined their development of a sensor for continuous and stable monitoring of respiration. Notably, the sensor is isolated from the effects of temperature and humidity of the respiratory airflow and is able to accurately discriminate between wheezing and normal respiration. \"Breath-carrying temperature and humidity co-exist and interfere with each other, so detecting breath temperature or humidity to characterize breath inevitably reduces accuracy and stability,\" explains the study's senior and co-corresponding author, Yuanjie Su, a professor at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. \"Typical respiratory sensors are enabled by assessing the expansion and contraction of the abdomen and chest during breathing, and they are immune to humidity and temperature.

Very rarely does the process also involve an undergraduate, a potential breakthrough for biomedical printing and cell therapy, and a little help from Bill Nye '77 the Science Guy. As an ambitious sophomore, Jared Matthews '21 was looking for a research project and he approached Lawrence Bonassar, the Daljit S. and Elaine Sarkaria Professor in Biomedical Engineering and in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering in Cornell Engineering. Together they created a smart sensor that attaches to the tip of a syringe to measure, in real time, the concentration and viability of the cells that pass through it—a device that would enable surgeons and biomanufacturers to produce higher quality implants of living tissue, even organs. \"A lot of inventions come out of this university,\" Bonassar said. \"Not a lot of them involve undergraduates, and not a lot of them happened during COVID.

It “opens up a complete new avenue [to rescue] this magnificent species and icon of conservation,” and may suggest strategies for generating stem cells for other vulnerable and endangered species. Researchers have already turned both mice and human skin cells, called fibroblasts, into stem cells, specifically pluripotent stem cells (SN: 12/24/14). These stem cells “have unlimited proliferation potential and can form any kind of cell, tissue or organ in the body under certain conditions,” says Liu Jing, a stem cell researcher at Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The catch with creating them is that the process must be tailored to each new species. To reprogram pandas’ fibroblasts into pluripotent stem cells, the team first put some genes known to reprogram adult cells into the skin cells along with small RNA molecules known to enhance the transition to stem cells. The researchers also had to identify the specific proteins and growth factors that would help turn the panda skin cells to stem cells, as well as ones that would keep them in the pluripotent state. Having pluripotent cells essentially on demand could allow scientists to create giant panda primordial germ cells, precursors to sperm and egg cells, a feat that’s been done in mice and northern white rhinos (SN: 10/17/16). Obtaining these panda sex cells has been difficult because the majority of the living panda population remains under strict protections that forbid typical egg extraction techniques, such as giving pandas medicine to make extra eggs in a cycle or retrieving eggs from ovaries.",

No other known bacteria reproduces in this way, researchers say. The strategy may allow C. matruchotii to quickly monopolize the human mouth, where it typically resides.\n\nC. matruchotii is a filamentous bacterium known to reside in plaque near the gum line. Microbiologist Scott Chimileski of the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass., noticed cells prolifically splitting as he and colleagues used time-lapse imaging to study live microbial communities in the human mouth (SN: 7/11/16).\n\n“Once he presented the finding, we thought, ‘Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing,’” says study coauthor Gary Borisy, a microbiologist at the ADA Forsyth Institute in Cambridge, Mass.\n\nSome other types of bacteria can divide many times at once to generate spores — dormant cells that can later become active daughter cells. But no other known species divides into many daughter cells that then also immediately start growing and dividing, the researchers say.\n\nThe unique reproductive strategy might allow C. matruchotii to quickly claim a lot of territory. “When we brush our teeth, we brush the bacteria away. But by the next day, it’s back,” Borisy says. “We think it just crawls up by rapidly expanding into fresh territory.”\n\nThe team next plans to study how C. matruchotii forms a biofilm that other bacteria in the mouth bind to, which could have implications for oral health.",

They are the only known type of fundamental subatomic particle for which this basic property is unknown, and some researchers suspect that this missing knowledge could be a gateway to a new understanding of physics. “Neutrinos are one of the key particles that we do not understand as well as we do others, but that have nevertheless profound cosmological consequences,” says particle cosmologist Miguel Escudero of the European particle physics lab CERN near Geneva. The little particles’ outsize role in sculpting the universe means they bridge the gap between the subatomic world, usually studied at particle accelerators or physics labs, and the cosmological one discerned by peering out at the heavens. So scientists are using both observations of space and experiments on the ground in an attempt to solve this massive mystery. But if you ask a cosmologist how much neutrinos weigh and ask a particle physicist the same question, you might get two different answers. The two groups’ methods of gauging those masses are showing signs of a disconnect. Recent cosmological data collected by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, or DESI, favors masses that are unexpectedly small and creeping close to conflict with those of particle physics experiments. In fact, some interpretations of the DESI data suggest that neutrinos have no mass or even negative mass, normally a forbidden concept in physics (SN: 11/21/14). The odd result has physicists considering some tantalizing ideas — that neutrinos’ masses might change over the history of the universe, or that the apparent negative masses are an illusion caused by dark energy, the mysterious phenomenon causing the universe to expand at an accelerating rate.",

Whether they will return to the tactic of erecting protest encampments, as happened on nearly 100 campuses last spring, is uncertain. Proponents of the encampments felt that their cause was urgent, that occupying space to protest is a time-honored tactic in the tradition of the civil-rights movement, and that calling police to clear encampments was violent authoritarianism. Critics of encampments countered that, when deployed last semester, they disrupted teaching and learning, violated the rights of many students to traverse their own campuses, caused some to fear for their physical safety, sparked violence, and imposed those costs and others without ending the war in Gaza or having any realistic chance of doing so. The practical, legal, and moral arguments against occupying the quad add up to a protest tactic with costs that far outweigh any benefits. Some of the problems with encampments are obvious, others subtle; taken together, they show that academic communities cannot thrive when any group uses coercion to try to force others to adopt its ideas––an approach that usually fails anyway. Activists should reject encampments as both unethical and ineffective. UCLA offers a case study in what’s wrong with encampments. Royce Quad is a space many students crisscross to access central parts of campus. On April 25, pro-Palestine protesters formed an encampment with barricades. Entrances were guarded by activists, many of them masked. They barred entry to students who support Israel’s existence.",

Some student activists harassed, intimidated, and vilified their Jewish peers, or attempted to restrict the movements of suspected Zionists. In response, several institutions, including Stanford, Harvard, Columbia, and the University of Pennsylvania, created task forces to study anti-Semitism on their campuses. Now those task forces have begun to release reports with findings and recommendations. Stanford found anti-Semitism to be “widespread.” Harvard reported that Jews and Israelis faced “shunning, harassment, and intimidation.” Columbia found that they “have been the object of racist epithets and graffiti, anti-Semitic tropes, and confrontational and unwelcome questions.” All of the task forces explored how to protect Jews from discrimination, harassment, and barriers to educational access, while also honoring commitments to free speech.

After George Floyd’s murder in 2020, he signed laws barring cops from using a controversial chokehold and requiring independent probes in police shootings, bragging that “California has advanced a new conversation about broader criminal justice reform.”\n\nBut since his second term began last year, he has more often talked like a tough-on-crime conservative, promoting efforts to hire more cops; to surge state police into high-crime cities; to impose harsher penalties on drug dealers, car burglars, and retail thieves; to install more surveillance cameras; and to deploy state prosecutors to Alameda County, where the progressive district attorney is flailing. “An arrest isn’t enough,” Newsom said this year, urging more prosecutions. “Whether it’s ‘bipping’ or carjacking, attempted murder or fentanyl trafficking, individuals must be held accountable for their crimes using the full and appropriate weight of the law.”\n\nMark Leibovitch: Gavin Newsom can’t help himself\n\nThat hard pivot to the politics of law and order describes not only California’s governor, but the Golden State as a whole. Voters and the politicians who represent them, mostly Democrats, embraced progressive attitudes and rhetoric toward criminal-justice reform for at least a decade. By the summer of 2020, the University of Southern California politics professor Dan Schnur told the Financial Times, “it appeared we were witnessing a seminal shift in public thinking on these issues.” But just two years later, he continued, “more traditional approaches to public safety” were resurgent.",

In 1984, George Orwell coined the term thoughtcrime. In the short story “The Minority Report,” the science-fiction author Philip K. Dick gave us the concept of “precrime,” describing a society where would-be criminals were arrested before they could act. Now Canada is combining the concepts in a work of dystopian nonfiction: A bill making its way through Parliament would impose draconian criminal penalties on hate speech and curtail people’s liberty in order to stop future crimes they haven’t yet committed. The Online Harms Act states that any person who advocates for or promotes genocide is “liable to imprisonment for life.” It defines lesser “hate crimes” as including online speech that is “likely to foment detestation or vilification” on the basis of race, religion, gender, or other protected categories. And if someone “fears” they may become a victim of a hate crime, they can go before a judge, who may summon the preemptively accused for a sort of precrime trial. If the judge finds “reasonable grounds” for the fear, the defendant must enter into “a recognizance.”\n\nA recognizance is no mere promise to refrain from committing hate crimes. The judge may put the defendant under house arrest or electronic surveillance and order them to abstain from alcohol and drugs. Refusal to “enter the recognizance” for one year results in 12 months in prison. This is madness.",

A mass shooting at a nearby elementary school. Faculty and student enthusiasm for protest movements such as Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter. A social reckoning like #MeToo. Thugs storming the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. In the moment, the benefits of making a statement feel as though they outweigh the costs. But the costs are real and cumulative, as Harvard has learned in the seven months since Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel. Alumni and students on both sides of the Gaza conflict have called on the school to condemn the atrocities of their enemies, or sympathize with their pain, or affirm their political positions, values, sentiments, or sense of morality. It could not please everyone, and its president, Claudine Gay, had to step down under pressure. In a report released on Tuesday, Harvard has come to the wise conclusion that the institution should stop issuing “official statements about public matters that do not directly affect the university’s core function.”\n\nRobert P. George: Universities should not be ideological churches\n\nIt will be interesting to see whether Harvard’s leaders can heed that advice and resist making statements through Election Day. Until then, other institutions would be wise to follow Harvard’s example and adopt their own policy of institutional neutrality. Universities have never possessed moral clarity. Knowledge creation requires rewarding dissent and epistemic modesty, qualities that are incompatible with institutional solidarity or real-time judgments about who is on “the right side of history.”\n\nInstitutional neutrality is most closely associated with the University of Chicago, where the Kalven report was adopted in 1967.",

On Sunday at Duke University, the comedian Jerry Seinfeld delivered a commencement address that was, bizarrely, overshadowed in the media by a tiny, nondisruptive protest. Seinfeld gave a compliment and a warning to his Gen Z audience. First came the compliment. “I totally admire the ambitions of your generation to create a more just and inclusive society,” he said. “I think it is also wonderful that you care so much about not hurting other people’s feelings in the million and one ways we all do that.”\n\nThen came the warning. “What I need to tell you as a comedian: Do not lose your sense of humor. You can have no idea at this point in your life how much you are going to need it to get through. Not enough of life makes sense for you to be able to survive it without humor.”\n\nSeinfeld went on to defend “the slightly uncomfortable feeling of awkward humor,” arguing that it is “not something you need to fix,” because even as Gen Z improves the world, it will remain “a pretty insane mess.” Humor, he said, is “the most survival-essential quality you will ever have or need to navigate through the human experience.”\n\nTyler Austin Harper: America’s colleges are reaping what they sowed\n\nAll of that is newsworthy.

As President Joe Biden said Tuesday at the Holocaust Memorial Museum, “This hatred continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world and requires our continued vigilance.” But the Antisemitism Awareness Act is the wrong way to fight those ills. If passed by the Senate and signed into law, it would codify a controversial definition of anti-Semitism (among its 11 specific examples of anti-Semitic rhetoric: “The existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor”). And it would direct the Department of Education to consider that definition when judging complaints against colleges under Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which says that no person, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, can be “excluded from participation” in a program, denied its benefits, or “be subjected to discrimination.”\n\nInterpreting Title VI has always been difficult and contested, particularly when speech that is protected by the First Amendment is alleged to be discriminatory as well. The act should be rejected by the Senate. Its definition of anti-Semitism is too expansive to serve as a unifying standard in academia, and it doubles down on an approach to antidiscrimination that chills free speech while failing to reduce hate.

        "text": "Updated at 10:58 a.m. ET on April 27, 2024. At Columbia University, administrators and pro-Palestinian students occupying the main quad on campus are in a standoff. President Minouche Shafik has satisfied neither those clamoring for order nor those who want untrammeled protests. Yet a different leader may not have performed any better. The tensions here between free-speech values and antidiscrimination law are unusually complex and difficult, if not impossible, to resolve. Shafik presides over a lavishly funded center of research, teaching, civic acculturation, and student activism. Such institutions cannot thrive without strong free-speech cultures. Neither can they thrive without limits on when and where protests are permitted—especially when protesters disrupt the institution as a tactic to get what they want. As Shafik told Congress in recent testimony, “Trying to reconcile the free-speech rights of those who want to protest and the rights of Jewish students to be in an environment free of harassment or discrimination has been the central challenge on our campus, and many others, in recent months.”\n\nThat is a formidable challenge. The best protest rules are viewpoint-neutral: They constrain equally, rather than coercively disadvantaging one side in a controversy. How strictly should they be enforced? Whatever the answer, it must apply equally to all students. Yet consistent support for viewpoint neutrality is rare inside and outside academia, especially on an issue as fraught as Israel-Palestine, which has divided Columbia’s faculty and students for decades. All of that context informed a flash point that occurred at Columbia last week: As Palestine-aligned protesters occupied the quad, where many activists covered their face to obscure their identity, Shafik declared, “I have determined that the encampment and related disruptions pose a clear and present danger to the substantial functioning of the University.” After repeatedly warning students to leave and suspending them when they refused, she called the NYPD to remove them from campus, citing vague safety concerns.",

Kennedy, an eminent scholar of race and civil rights, published an op-ed in The Harvard Crimson denouncing the use of diversity, equity, and inclusion statements in academic hiring. “I am a scholar on the left committed to struggles for social justice,” he wrote. “The realities surrounding mandatory DEI statements, however, make me wince.”\n\nMore and more colleges started requiring faculty to submit these statements in recent years, until legislatures in red states began to outlaw them. They remain common at private institutions and in blue states. Kennedy lamented that at Harvard and elsewhere, aspiring professors are required to “profess and flaunt” their faith in DEI in a process that “leans heavily and tendentiously towards varieties of academic leftism.” He concluded that DEI statements “ought to be abandoned.”\n\nConor Friedersdorf: The hypocrisy of mandatory diversity statements\n\nBut a “contrasting perspective” on diversity statements that the Crimson published argued that “furor over diversity statements in hiring is a red herring.” Edward J. Hall, a Harvard philosophy professor, acknowledged flaws in the way DEI statements are currently used, going so far as to declare, “I share my colleague professor Randall L. Kennedy’s anger.” However, he continued, “we should direct that anger at its proper target: not diversity statements themselves, but rather the horribly distorted view that has taken hold about what they should contain.”\n\nThe headline of his op-ed, “Don’t Eliminate.

Roughly a decade after the movement for diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI, began to spread in American higher education, a political backlash is here. The Chronicle of Higher Education has tallied 80 bills since 2023 that aim to restrict DEI in some way, by banning DEI offices, mandatory diversity training, faculty diversity statements, and more. Eight have already become law, including in Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Tennessee, North Dakota, and Utah. The worst of these laws violate academic independence and free speech by attempting to forbid certain ideas in the classroom. Utah’s Equal Opportunities Initiatives, or H.B. 261, which was signed into law in January, is more promising. It attempts to end the excessive and at times coercive focus on identity in higher education while also trying to protect academic freedom with carve-outs for research and course teaching. The law prohibits universities from giving individuals preferential treatment or discriminating against them based on race, color, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, or gender identity. It forbids offices that help students from excluding anyone based on their identity. It bans mandatory campus training sessions that promote differential treatment. It prohibits “discriminatory practices,” such as ascribing “values, morals, or ethical codes, privileges, or beliefs to an individual” because of their identity.

Henderson shares that anecdote in his new memoir, Troubled, an account of his upbringing in foster care and his escape into the Air Force and higher education. For him, “Monogamy is kind of outdated” is a “luxury belief,” a term he coined. He defines it as an idea or opinion “that confer[s] status on the upper class, at very little cost, while often inflicting costs on the lower classes.” Henderson suggests that members of the upper class know, on some level, that these luxury beliefs are harmful, because, like the woman at Yale, they have no intention of putting them into practice in their own life. Brad Wilcox: The awfulness of elite hypocrisy on marriage\n\nHe developed the concept while observing how social class operates at Yale, where he felt like an outsider because he had such a difficult childhood. In his telling, people become more preoccupied with social status when their material needs are met, and people at prestigious and thus influential institutions are more interested than most in seeking still more prestige. This upper class once signaled status with “material accouterments,” Henderson argues. But now luxury goods are so widely available that the affluent “have decoupled social status from goods and reattached it to beliefs.”\n\n“Luxury beliefs” is a clever, thought-provoking conceptual framework that pithily captures some truths about American culture and politics.",

And if he wins the GOP nomination, he has a very good shot at winning the presidency. So it’s worth entertaining the strongest argument against Trump, which many Americans haven’t heard before: that Trump brings out the worst in many of us—his critics and supporters alike. To really make this anti-Trump argument, one must go so far as to acknowledge that the anti-Trump coalition has sometimes engaged in unreason, hysteria, and abuses of power. The name for this phenomenon is Trump Derangement Syndrome. In 2003, the conservative writer Charles Krauthammer coined the term Bush Derangement Syndrome to describe “the acute onset of paranoia in otherwise normal people in reaction to the policies, the presidency––nay––the very existence of George W. Bush.” The idea wasn’t that any opposition to Bush or his policies was deranged, but rather that Bush hatred was causing some of the president’s critics to indulge in preposterous claims, such as asserting that he’d known the 9/11 attacks were coming. Trump Derangement Syndrome is similar but more intense and widespread. I’m 44. I remember extreme hatred of numerous politicians, including Bill Clinton, Bush, and Barack Obama. But nothing comes close to the reaction to Trump’s presidency. Many Americans hold as an article of faith that Trump is a tool of Russia and a fascistic danger to democracy who ought to be thrown off the ballot in all 50 states and imprisoned for life.",

Other popular answers included “polarized” and “dysfunctional.”\n\nThose of us who feel that way may be tempted to tune out this election year. To participate in politics is to encounter many otherwise lovely people at their most upset, angry, and uncharitable. To withdraw from it is, for many, to avoid stress, annoyance, and maybe even negative psychological outcomes associated with daily political engagement. Opting out sounds sensible in that telling. But if affable, pragmatic, constructive sorts opt out of civic life, repelled by its disagreeableness, the future will be shaped to a growing degree by unreasonable zealots who will make our politics more stressful and dysfunctional. Avoiding that future requires a bigger share of circumspect people to participate. Read: You should go to a Trump rally\n\nYou can already see the ill effect that negative polarization has had on politics. Since 2016, voter turnout has been relatively high, but not because the public is enthusiastic about what’s going on in the country. Americans think of people in the other party as immoral, dishonest, and close-minded. Donald Trump is especially adept at drawing to the polls both his biggest sycophants and voters who abhor him and want him defeated more than anything. If only as a calming influence, I want more Americans who are alienated by negative polarization to participate, not just in elections, but in political life more broadly. That doesn’t mean becoming an aggrieved shitposter on social media, or blocking traffic to impose your priorities on others, or subjecting colleagues to the bombastic talk-radio monologue that raised your blood pressure on the way to work, or spending social gatherings with family and friends berating them for their political beliefs.",

Updated at 1 p.m. ET on January 30, 2024. Zack De Piero taught writing for four years in the English department at Penn State’s Abington campus. Then he resigned and, in 2023, filed a lawsuit alleging that administrators and other faculty members discriminated against him because he is white. In his telling, the school’s diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by creating a hostile work environment. In response, hundreds of academics signed an open letter calling the lawsuit a reactionary attack on “ongoing efforts in diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging.”\n\nThe dispute, like so many in higher education, pits a faction that believes that the prevailing campus attitudes toward identity are racist against a faction that believes that they help fight racism. It is hardly unique in raising the question of whether DEI initiatives ever go too far. Still, this case stands out, not only because it resulted in a federal lawsuit, but because earlier this month, a judge denied Penn State’s motion to dismiss De Piero’s hostile-workplace claim. The case can now move forward. The ruling comes as backlash against DEI initiatives is growing and questions about when they violate antidiscrimination law remain unsettled. More significant, it establishes a standard that federal judges of varying ideologies could plausibly adopt, and that other plaintiffs can use to bring bias claims to trial. This isn’t a case where, say, a white Donald Trump appointee who hates academia took an extreme position, like “Any departure from color-blindness is illegal,” that would be overturned on appeal.",

        "text": "By Brian O’Flynn and Helen Johnson\n\nJunior doctors in England voted this week to accept the government’s pay deal after months of industrial action. Though it supported the deal, the doctors’ union – the British Medical Association (BMA) – says it still leaves junior doctors worse off than they were in 2009. FactCheck takes a look at the figures. How much will junior doctors get? The deal is equivalent to a 22 per cent pay rise over two years. Junior doctors will receive a rise of 13 per cent for the year ending March 2024, and a further 8 per cent for the year ending March 2025. Does this leave doctors worse off than in 2009? The British Medical Association said the pay offer “does not amount to full pay restoration”. By this, it means that junior doctors’ pay is still lower than it was in 2009, once we account for inflation. It calculates that junior doctors’ pay was 30 per cent lower in 2023 than in 2009 in “real terms” (i.e. after inflation). And it says the new deal would only partly reverse this loss – meaning by 2025, junior doctors’ pay would still be 20 per cent lower than in 2009. But FactCheck calculates that junior doctors’ pay actually fell in real terms by around 20 per cent, not 30 per cent as the BMA claims. And we estimate that the new pay deal would reduce this loss to around 3 per cent by 2025. That means that the planned pay rise would actually bring junior doctors very close to pay restoration – up to about 97 percent of their 2009 real-terms pay.",

So, what is Hezbollah, who is behind the attack, and how did they do it? Here’s what we know so far. Did Israel detonate Hezbollah pagers in Lebanon and why did they explode? Reuters reports that two sources, one from the Lebanese military, say Israel’s Mossad security services were behind the attack. The news agency says it’s been told that Israeli spies planted explosives inside 5,000 pagers which Hezbollah members were using to communicate. If that is true, it implies that Israeli operatives somehow gained access to the devices while they were being manufactured or distributed to Hezbollah members. Israel has not commented on the allegations. Who made the exploding Hezbollah pagers? According to Reuters’ Lebanese source, the devices were “Gold Apollo” branded – suggesting they were made by a company in Taiwan. But Gold Apollo denies manufacturing the pagers. It says it licensed the trademark to a Hungarian firm called BAC, which it claims produced the items. Gold Apollo’s boss, Hsu Ching Kuang, described the situation as “very embarrassing” and insisted “there was nothing in those devices that we had manufactured or exported to [BAC]”. What is a pager and why was Hezbollah using them? Pagers are wireless one-way communication devices that allow short messages to be sent to someone remotely using radio signals. They peaked in popularity in the 1990s, but have been mostly replaced by mobile phones.",

        "text": "The prime minister is facing controversy after it was revealed some of his wife’s clothes were bought by his biggest personal donor, Lord Alli. So, is this allowed and have any parliamentary rules been broken? FactCheck takes a look. What did Lord Alli donate to the Starmers? Labour donor and former chairman of online fashion retailer Asos, Lord Alli, covered the cost of a personal shopper, clothes and alterations for Victoria Starmer – both before and after Labour’s election win on 4 July – according to The Sunday Times. (The peer reportedly also gave the prime minister nearly £19,000 worth of work clothes, £20,000 of accommodation and provided a similar sum for “private office” costs – though these are not directly implicated in this row as they were all disclosed at the time, according to the paper.) Have parliamentary rules been broken? Like all MPs, the prime minister has to register all financial interests within 28 days of a new parliament beginning. This also includes donations to family members. But according to The Sunday Times, the prime minister’s office reportedly approached parliamentary authorities just last week in order to make a late declaration. The Conservative Party has called for “a full investigation” after “apparent serious breaches of parliamentary rules”. Downing Street has accepted that Sir Keir did initially fail to declare the donations. A spokeswoman for No 10 said: “We sought advice from the authorities on coming to office. “We believed we had been compliant, however, following further interrogation this month, we have declared further items.”\n\nAnd speaking to broadcasters yesterday, the prime minister said “it’s very important to me that the rules are followed,” before adding: “and that’s why, shortly after the election, my team reached out for advice on what declaration should be made so it’s in accordance with the rules”.",

But is this right? FactCheck takes a look. Will the triple lock ‘outstrip’ Winter Fuel Payment losses? The prime minister said during PMQs on 11 September that “we can make sure that, through the triple lock, increases in pensions will outstrip any loss of payment”, later adding: “we can commit ourselves to the triple lock, and that means that the state pension will increase by more than any loss of the Winter Fuel Payment.”\n\nFor context, the ‘triple lock’ means that the state pension goes up each year by either 2.5 per cent, inflation, or earnings growth – whichever is the highest. Someone receiving the full ‘new State Pension’ is expected to see an increase of £460.2 per year to their state pension between financial years 2024/25 and 2025/26. For singles, this is an increase of £460.2 and for couples an increase of £920.4. Someone receiving the full ‘Basic State Pension’ is expected to see an increase of £353.6 per year to their state pension between financial years 2024/25 and 2025/26. For singles, this is an increase of £353.6 and for couples an increase of £707.2. But the PM’s comments come after the new government decided to change who would be eligible to receive the Winter Fuel Payment of up to £300, with millions of pensioners to miss out this year. So, will triple lock increases offset Winter Fuel Payment losses?",

        "text": "By Claire Wilde\n\nWill an exodus of private school pupils “overwhelm” the state sector when VAT is added to school fees in January? FactCheck takes a look. What is the private school claim? It’s the last school term before one of the new government’s most debated pledges kicks in – VAT on private school fees will be charged across the UK from January. Many independent schools argue it will lead to an exodus of pupils from private settings, overloading an already-saturated state sector. Would state schools have room? FactCheck found most parts of the UK had plenty of capacity in state schools. A study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, cited by the government, suggests private schools could lose between 4 per cent and 7 per cent of pupils in the coming years because of the addition of VAT to fees. At secondary level, when any pressure would be most keenly felt, our exclusive analysis of Department for Education data found that 144 of 152 council areas in England would have enough available places to accommodate 7 per cent of local private school pupils in the 2025/26 school year. Eight would not have this level of spare places: Coventry, Manchester, Stoke-on-Trent, Telford & Wrekin, Rutland, Kingston Upon Thames, Salford and Richmond Upon Thames. The independent sector has argued that private schools could lose far more pupils – perhaps even as high as 25 per cent – in the coming years. FactCheck analysis showed that 136 council areas would still be able to accommodate 25 per cent of local private secondary pupils. 16 did not have that level of spare places.",

        "text": "The probation service for England and Wales has been working over capacity every month since January 2023, FactCheck can reveal. Figures obtained exclusively from the Ministry of Justice show the service has consistently been working at around 120 per cent capacity – meaning the average officer has about six days’ work to do in a five-day week. Our findings come as the government plans to release around 2,000 prisoners on a single day next week as part of plans to ease overcrowding – which is expected to put even more pressure on the probation system. FactCheck takes a look. How are probation workloads calculated? Probation officers have access to a “workload measurement tool“ which estimates how many hours of work are required to manage their caseload. If an officer is assigned a certain case, the tool will estimate how many hours of work that case will likely demand from the officer. We understand that the percentage workload compares the estimated number of hours it should take to manage all of an officer’s cases, to the amount of time that officer is actually contracted to work. So if an officer has 12 hours’ worth of work to do, but only 10 hours in which to do it, they would be deemed to have a workload of 120 per cent. Exclusive FactCheck figures\n\nWe obtained exclusive data about probation workload through a Freedom of Information request to the Ministry of Justice. The data shows that the probation service – which covers all of England and Wales – was working at an average of 120 per cent capacity across the months of 2023. For an individual officer, this would be equivalent to having six days’ worth of work to do in a five-day working week.",

FactCheck takes a look. What changes are being made to Ofsted inspection grades? The overall grade categories of ‘Outstanding’, ‘Good’, ‘Requires Improvement’ and ‘Inadequate’ will no longer be issued to schools with immediate effect. The headline grades – also known as single word judgements – have been used to summarise the overall performance of schools. But these are now being scrapped. So from today until September 2025, schools that are inspected will instead receive a rating in the four existing subcategories: quality of education, behaviour and attitudes, personal development, and leadership and management. As Ofsted inspection reports already contain these subcategories, parents will still be able to compare schools by looking at how they perform in each of these areas. But they won’t have a single word judgement covering the school as a whole to consider. Schools that already have an existing grade in place will keep this until they are next inspected. From September 2025, “School Report Cards” will be introduced, which the Department for Education says “will provide parents with a full and comprehensive assessment of how schools are performing”. Education secretary Bridget Phillipson, said: “Single headline grades are low information for parents and high stakes for schools. Parents deserve a much clearer, much broader picture of how schools are performing – that’s what our report cards will provide.”\n\nHow have parent groups and teachers reacted?",

So, why were payments dropped and who is affected? FactCheck takes a look. What is the Winter Fuel Payment and who is losing out? The Winter Fuel Payment was introduced in 1997 to help older people pay for their heating bills over the colder months. Up until now, it has given all pensioners born before 23 September 1958 – regardless of income – up to £300 each year. But chancellor Rachel Reeves announced last month that the government would be limiting the number of people who will get the yearly Winter Fuel Payment. From September onwards, only those receiving Pension Credit or other means-tested benefits will be eligible for the payment in England and Wales. She said the cuts were necessary to plug the government’s multi-billion pound “black hole” that it has between spending commitments and the cash that’s available to fund them. Around 1.3 million households in England and Wales will continue to receive Winter Fuel Payments, but about 10 million people will lose the allowance. The figure has been calculated by subtracting the number of people who get Pension Credit (1.4m) from the latest number of people who were in receipt of the Winter Fuel Payment (11.3m). A government spokesperson told FactCheck that “eligible pensioners will also be able to benefit from the £150 Warm Home Discount scheme from October to help with their energy bills over winter.”\n\n“We are urging pensioners to come forward and check their eligibility for Pension Credit to ensure as many people in need as possible have access to this support,” they added.",

FactCheck takes a look. How much will energy prices rise by? Ofgem said a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity would pay £1,717 a year from October – when the new price cap comes into place. This will be a £149 a year rise compared with a current typical annual bill of £1,568. The price cap – updated every quarter – sets the maximum amount suppliers can charge per unit of gas and electricity, with standing charges taken into account. It is not a cap on customers’ overall energy bills, which will still rise or fall in line with their energy consumption. Those living in larger properties tend to pay more overall due to higher energy usage, with those in smaller properties usually paying less. How much have prices risen since 2019? The price cap was first introduced by Ofgem on 1 January 2019 to make sure that energy bills accurately reflected the cost of energy. The below graph from Ofgem shows how the average annual cost has changed since then. Prices were relatively stable at around £1,000 until they began to rise in summer 2022 to around £1,900, reflecting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine earlier that year. Prices reached a peak of £4,000 a year by March 2023. By the following winter, they’d fallen again – and have mostly declined since the start of this year. But as of October, the average household will still pay £628 more than they did in the winter of 2019/20.",

So why is the proposal surprising and could it work? We’ve spoken to one of the UK’s leading security experts, Professor Michael Clarke, to find out. What is NATO? The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is an alliance of European and North American countries, including the US and UK. Its key principle is shared defence – so if one member is attacked, the other nations must provide support under Article 5 of the founding treaty. Why isn’t Ukraine part of NATO? Ukraine has been slowly edging towards NATO membership in recent decades. In 2008, the alliance agreed that “Ukraine will become a member”. And from 2017, Kyiv began passing laws distancing itself from Russia and moving closer to Western allies. But when Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, this progress was cast into doubt. NATO states provided financial and military support, but stopped short of admitting Ukraine into the bloc. The thinking goes that if Ukraine becomes part of NATO, the other member states will be obliged to defend it against Russian aggression. That could mean direct warfare between nuclear powers – NATO members the US, UK and France versus Russia – which no one wants. What did the Czech President say about Ukraine joining NATO? That’s why the Czech President’s comments this week were so surprising. He told the Czech news site Novinky that “full restoration of control over the entire territory [of Ukraine] is not a necessary prerequisite” for NATO membership.",

This is the first case of this variant to be diagnosed outside the African continent, although it was contracted during a stay in Africa, according to the Swedish authorities. The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the outbreak of the Clade 1 strain a public health emergency of “international concern” on 14 August. So, what is the infection, what are the symptoms and is there a vaccine? Let’s take a look. What is mpox? Mpox – previously known as monkeypox – is a rare infection that is most commonly found in west or central Africa. Anyone can get mpox and it can be passed on from person to person through close physical contact with blisters or scabs, touching the clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with mpox, and the coughs or sneezes of a person with the infection when they’re close to you. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is in the middle of an outbreak of Clade 1, with confirmed cases reaching countries across Africa. In the DRC, there’s been more than 15,600 cases of mpox so far this year, and 537 deaths. In 2022, there was an outbreak of the Clade 2 mpox variant, which was first detected in London. It resulted in 87,000 cases across 110 countries and 112 deaths. Are there any UK cases of Clade 1 mpox? So far in the UK, there have been no recorded cases of the Clade 1 variant during the current outbreak.",

Our findings come as university leaders sound the alarm over a fall in international student recruitment – on which the sector has become increasingly reliant in recent years. FactCheck takes a look. Plugging the gap\n\nCuts in direct government funding have meant that tuition fees are now the sector’s main source of income. Tuition fees used to make up around 64 per cent of universities’ total teaching income in 2012 – but this has since increased to over 90 per cent, according to Commons Library. And there’s a limit on the amount universities can bill UK students. In England, that cap has been fixed at £9,250 since 2017 – despite significant inflation since then. Meanwhile, institutions are free to charge foreign students much more – around £22,000 a year on average. Financial vulnerability\n\nFactCheck analysis of the most recent higher education financial data shows just how dependent many universities are on these international applicants. On average, we find that universities get around 20 per cent of their total income – that’s all the money they receive from fees, grants, and everything else – just from international tuition fees. And this figure is much higher for some universities. We calculate that one in six universities get more than 33 per cent of their total income from overseas students. And 14 universities we’ve identified get more than 40 per cent of their income this way. Our analysis looks at data from the latest available financial year – in most cases, the year ending March 2023.",

Let’s take a look. In opposition and now in power, Labour has claimed that its plans for net zero – including the creation of a “publicly owned clean energy company”, GB Energy – will “lower bills”. The question is: by how much? Before the election, Keir Starmer said that his policies would “help families save up to £300 off their energy bills”. The claimed savings would kick in from 2030. But this number was missing from the official announcement of the GB Energy plans on 25 July. A journalist from the Times challenged Keir Starmer on the figure after a speech he gave that day. The reporter asked: “During the election campaign Labour suggested bills would be brought down around £300 a year by 2030 by your net zero energy plans. Do you stand by that figure? How much can households expect to save?”. Sir Keir replied: “Yes I do. I stand by everything in our manifesto and one of the things I made clear in the election campaign is I wouldn’t make a single promise or commitment that I didn’t think we could deliver in government.”\n\nBut after repeated email requests from FactCheck to explain how the £300 figure was calculated, and whether the government still stands by it, the energy department appeared to back away from the number.

And of those that have been inspected, over 40 per cent were last inspected more than five years ago – while around 13 per cent were last inspected more than ten years ago. Regulator under fire\n\nThe Care Quality Commission (CQC) regulates all aspects of the health and social care sector in England, from GPs to care homes. It has faced criticism in recent days as an independent review found “significant failings” in its effectiveness. An interim report by the review said that the watchdog had failed to provide a rating for an estimated one in five of all the locations under its purview. Our findings: NHS acute hospitals\n\nOur exclusive FactCheck analysis of the CQC’s own data looks at one part of the regulator’s remit: NHS acute hospitals. That’s where patients “receive active, short-term treatment for a condition”, according to the Health Foundation think tank. So that’s things like A&E and maternity units, but not GP or community-based services. Our analysis finds that a third of NHS acute hospitals have never been inspected while being run by their current provider – that means the organisation which runs the hospital. This is usually an NHS Trust. Our figure could include hospitals that were inspected when a different provider was in charge, though we understand any such cases can only represent a small fraction of the total. Of those NHS hospitals that have been inspected under their current provider, we’ve found that over 40 per cent haven’t been inspected for five years or more – and 13 per cent haven’t been inspected for over a decade.",

Ten other regional Teamsters councils have issued statements of support for Harris, including in the battleground states of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Nevada. \"Trump wishes your bosses could just fire you for challenging their authority with a strike. Never forget that. Trump wants to eliminate your legally protected right to challenge your employer and demand the dignity and respect all hardworking Teamsters deserve,\" said Rick Hicks, president of Teamsters Joint Council 28, in the division’s official endorsement of Harris.

Instead, hubris might just hand the Keystone State to the GOP in 2024. As Allegheny County limps toward another election cycle, Republicans are eyeing an opportunity born not of their own strength, but of Democratic complacency and voter disillusionment. The numbers paint a grim picture. Allegheny County hemorrhaged nearly 7,800 residents last year alone, placing it in the top 10 for population loss nationwide. Even more alarming, the county has shed 50,000 jobs in the past five years – five times more than any other Pennsylvania county. The county’s most impoverished suburbs, home to many recent immigrants and other non-white minorities, are facing another round of white flight. On top of that, the future looks even bleaker for those officials tasked with educating future generations of gainfully-employed citizens: Pittsburgh Public Schools are mulling the closure of 16 schools, a move that would disproportionately impact working-class neighborhoods. Yet you'd never know any of this listening to the county's Democratic leadership. Take newly-minted County Executive Sara Innamorato. In 2018, she rode a wave of Democratic Socialists of America-fueled primary upsets to unseat center-left incumbent Dom Costa in the state legislature, infamously referring to the working-class voters she grew up with as “racist” along the way. By 2019, she’d ditched the DSA affiliation and made some concessions to organized labor, like many other young Democrats, but kept some of the progressive bona fides. Her narrow victory over well-funded Republican Joe Rockey in the county executive race in 2023 should have been a wake-up call.",

On September 9, ABC News published an article highlighting GOP vice presidential nominee and Ohio Sen. J.D.

The claims are misleading. “Here’s the Springfield, OH city manager in March admitting he too has heard stories about Haitians eating ‘domesticated animals,’” right-wing activist Charlie Kirk posted on Threads. “Amuse,” a conservative account with more than 400,000 followers, tweeted: “ABC News falsely claimed the Springfield City Manager refuted Trump’s debate statement.

The Uncommitted National Movement, largely made up of Democrats who raised protests during the party’s primaries and the party’s convention, said Thursday it will not endorse Harris for president due to her views on Israel’s war in Gaza. “Vice President Harris’s unwillingness to shift on unconditional weapons policy or to even make a clear statement in support of upholding existing US and international human rights law has made it impossible for us to endorse her,” movement co-founder Abbas Alawieh said on a press call. However, Alawieh said he himself would vote for Harris, and another co-founder, Layla Elabed, encouraged members to “register anti-Trump votes.”\n\nOhio Gov.

It is one of those things that everybody knows that isn’t true. In reality, Wall Street has been trending Democratic for decades, for reasons that are not difficult to guess. Financial services firms tend to be concentrated in big cities and staffed by college-educated professionals—and affluent urban voters today lean Democratic, as do their nearby suburban counterparts. And even though what we call “Wall Street” doesn’t really live on Wall Street anymore, the business is culturally dominated by people with big city, East Coast backgrounds. The CEOs of JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley were born in New York City, while David Solomon of Goldman Sachs came all the way from … Westchester County. Affluent urban and suburban professionals have trended Democratic only partly because of policy considerations. In the main part, their migration has been more driven by cultural and social sensibilities. As the GOP has become more southern, more evangelical, and more demonstratively boobish, people working in finance have moved into the party of Barack Obama. Considering one of the forerunners of today’s Republican populism, one Wall Street veteran told me in 2008: “Nobody is going to show up to parents’ day at Choate wearing a Sarah Palin T-shirt.”\n\nSo, how’s it going?

And when it doesn’t, that’s unacceptable. If you’re into politics, one of those time-honored rules is that presidential debates don’t matter. Millions tune in, shout at the television, argue over who won or lost, and when the smoke clears, there’s zero evidence that it moved any meaningful number of votes. That’s not my opinion. To quote Ron Burgundy: It’s science. Some old people do better than others in adapting to change, though. On June 26, a day before Joe Biden and Donald Trump met to debate, Old Man Goldberg made a bold prediction. “I have changed my mind,” he declared. “This week’s presidential debate matters.”\n\nHe would be vindicated in that prediction, and in this one: “Fair or not, if Biden has a major malfunction, it will be an irreparable confirmation of voter concerns about his age. I would expect the whispers about replacing him on the ticket to become shouts almost overnight.”\n\nPretty good—but he wasn’t done. Jonah also imagined a debate victory scenario for Democrats. “Most voters do not like [Trump] and pretty much never have,” he reasoned. “If he leans into the traits that turn them off—if he follows that age-old advice, ‘Be yourself’—and Biden is even modestly reassuring, the double-haters and other undecideds could easily break for the president.”\n\nSwap in “Kamala Harris” for “Biden” and “vice president” for “president” in that passage, and you have an astute prediction of how last week’s presidential debate would play out politically.",

Recently, a social media post claiming that reducing interest rates would do more than a subsidy to lower mortgage payments has gone viral across several platforms. “A $325k home with a $25k tax credit bringing the cost to $300k with a 7% interest rate is $1991 a month,” Facebook user Jason Dean Longo posted. “A $325k home at 3.25% is $1414 a month. That’s a $577 a month difference and over 30 years a savings of $207,720.”\n\nTexas real estate agent Ashley Taylor Cooper reshared Longo’s post, and her post has been shared more than 29,000 times on Facebook and made its way to X. The post’s theoretical example gets the math right in terms of how monthly payments are calculated. However, according to Federal Reserve Economic Data, the 30-year fixed rate mortgage average in the United States is 6.2 percent and was at 6.99 percent as recently as June 6. Monthly mortgage payments can be calculated with the following formula, where r is the monthly interest rate and n is the number of months of payment. Although the interest rate figures used in the example are likely annual rates—not monthly rates that banks tend to use—that figure can be easily converted by dividing by the number of months in a year, 12. Therefore, the respective interest rates of 7 percent and 3.25 percent cited in the viral post convert to monthly interest rates of 0.58333 and 0.27803, respectively.",

Police said the claim is “unfounded.”\n\nFull Story\n\nTwo assassination attempts have been aimed at former President Donald Trump during the 2024 presidential race. The first attempt occurred July 13 during a campaign rally in western Pennsylvania, when 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks fired shots from the roof of a nearby building, grazing Trump in the right ear. Crooks was killed by Secret Service agents at the scene. One rally attendee died in the shooting and two others were injured. Another apparent assassination attempt occurred Sept. 15, when a Secret Service agent saw the barrel of a gun and opened fire in the direction of Ryan Wesley Routh, who was reportedly hiding in trees with a loaded, SKS-style semiautomatic rifle with a scope near Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, where the former president was playing a round of golf. Routh fled the scene and was later arrested on gun charges, pending a further investigation that could result in more serious charges. But a recent claim of a possible third attempt on Trump’s life has been debunked by police and the Secret Service following a campaign rally at the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, New York, on Sept. 18.

Social media posts subsequently repeated a plethora of false or baseless claims, including that COVID-19 vaccines cause the viral disease or that the current outbreak is part of a global conspiracy. Full Story\n\nMpox is a viral disease caused by the monkeypox virus, found in small mammals in parts of Africa. The virus historically has caused limited outbreaks in humans after spreading to them from animals. It causes a painful rash and is sometimes lethal, although it causes less severe disease than the related smallpox virus. As we’ve previously written, there are two main types, or clades, of the virus. A version of the virus belonging to clade II spread around the world in humans in an outbreak starting in 2022, primarily affecting men who have sex with men. The outbreak continues, albeit with lower levels of infection globally than at its peak. Meanwhile, another family of mpox-causing viruses belonging to clade I has been on the rise in parts of Africa, and in 2023, a subset of these viruses started to show sustained spread among people in the Democratic Republic of Congo and some nearby countries. (For more, see SciCheck’s “Q&A on the Second International Mpox Emergency.”)\n\nIn recognition of the surge of mpox in Africa, the World Health Organization last month declared a public health emergency of international concern, which doctors and scientists hope will spur global collaboration to support affected countries in responding to the ongoing mpox epidemics.",

In 2022, mpox — a disease caused by the monkeypox virus, which is found in small mammals and has been known to infect people in parts of Africa for decades — burst into greater international awareness. The virus, which causes a painful rash and can be deadly, spread around the world, primarily among men who have sex with men. In response, the World Health Organization and the U.S. government declared public health emergencies. Mpox cases outside Africa subsequently decreased, and the public health emergencies were declared over in 2023. The global outbreak is still ongoing, but case numbers have fallen significantly. In the U.S., for example, the number of people diagnosed with mpox is down from a high of 11,000 cases per month in the summer of 2022 to 250 cases per month now, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, the situation in Africa in recent years has noticeably worsened. On Aug. 14, the WHO once again declared an mpox public health emergency of international concern. A day earlier, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention had declared a public health emergency of continental security. Especially in the Democratic Republic of Congo, mpox cases are surging — this time primarily from two other types of the virus. As of late August, there have been more than 20,000 mpox cases and more than 600 deaths reported in Africa in 2024, although not all are confirmed cases, given a dearth of access to testing. This compares with around 15,000 reported cases in 2023. One type of the virus has now spread to countries in Africa where mpox has not been historically reported.",

Poersch, a former director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Poersch was named the super PAC’s president in early 2017. Other senior staff include Amanda Ach, digital director, and Ghada Alkiek, political manager. Ach previously worked for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and Alkiek was deputy chief of staff to Rep. Dan Kildee of Michigan. As a super PAC, the Senate Majority PAC is allowed to raise and spend unlimited amounts, but it must report expenditures and all donations of more than $200 to the Federal Election Commission. The group cannot make contributions to candidate committees and cannot coordinate independent expenditures with candidate campaigns. As of June 30, SMP had raised about $167 million and spent more than $53 million in the 2024 election cycle, according to an analysis of FEC data by OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan group that tracks money in politics. Much of its spending was on fundraising, administrative expenses and strategy and research. Majority Forward, an affiliated 501(c)(4) organization that does not have to disclose its donors, has contributed almost $16 million to SMP, and two liberal super PACs, Democracy PAC and Working for Working Americans, have given $10 million and $9 million, respectively.

The complaint, which was filed in an administrative court, has not yet been made public, as it is undergoing redactions. Agency officials expect it to be made public on Monday. But we know a few things about the complaint thus far. The three companies in the lawsuit are Caremark Rx, Express Scripts, and Optum Rx. These PBMs are involved in about 80 percent of all drug transactions, and each is tied to a large insurance company (Caremark/CVS Aetna, Express Scripts/Cigna, and Optum Rx/UnitedHealth). The FTC is alleging that the rebate system used by these three companies and their affiliated group purchasing organizations (GPOs) creates incentives to increase insulin prices, forcing many of the eight million patients who use insulin to pay more. The practices have the effect of increasing list prices for insulin that patients without insurance must pay, as well as increasing costs for those with insurance. More from David Dayen\n\nSpecifically, PBMs use formularies—lists of drugs that they cover—to provide exclusive or near-exclusive use of certain types of insulins. In doing so, the PBMs are not preferring the lowest-price insulins, but the ones that give them the highest rebates, which is how they profit.

Signs have been mounting that, for the first time in recent decades, Democrats may lose majority support from young men in 2024. The risk to Democrats is that this is not just a one-time fluke but an indication of growing trouble with men in coming elections. Democrats can celebrate the support they are getting from young women, but they also need to take the disaffection of young men seriously, engage them directly, and respond to the visions of manhood and masculinity that Donald Trump and J.D. Vance are offering. Although men overall have moved toward the Republicans over the past half-century, the youth vote has given Democrats grounds for hope that the losses among men have been transitional, a reflection of an older generation’s difficulties in adjusting to more equal gender relations and a changed economy. Young men’s support for Democrats reached a high point in Barack Obama’s victories. According to exit polls in 2008 , Obama won 62 percent of 18-to-29-year-old men as well as 69 percent of women that age. By 2020 , the gender gap among young voters had widened, but Joe Biden still received the votes of 52 percent of young men along with 67 percent of young women.

Donald Trump’s recent bid for votes by giving away a host of tax benefits and exemptions would bring the total cost of his tax plan to between $8.5 trillion and $9.75 trillion over a decade, according to a Prospect review of estimates by tax study organizations. Over the last few months, Trump has vowed to eliminate taxes on tips, cancel taxes on Social Security benefits, end taxes on overtime pay, reduce the corporate tax rate to 15 percent for domestic manufacturers and 20 percent for other corporations, and repeal the cap on the state and local tax deduction (SALT) that he himself signed into law in the 2017 Trump tax cuts. (He has also called for a deduction of “major newborn expenses” but since he gave no indication of what a major expense is, that is impossible to model.) Trump would extend all of the other tax cuts in his 2017 law other than that SALT cap. The cost of that extension has already been put at $4.6 trillion over ten years, but if the SALT cap is not retained, that would cost another $1.2 trillion. Total estimates for a 2017 tax cut extension without the SALT cap, as listed by tax analysts, ranges between $5.1 trillion from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, to $5.3 trillion from the Tax Foundation, to $5.8 trillion if you add the Congressional Budget Office estimate to the CRFB estimate of the cost of SALT cap repeal.",

North Carolina had moved young offenders in a productive direction. Under the state’s 2019 Raise the Age (RTA) reforms, juvenile offenders had a chance to avoid marring their lives with convictions that would hinder their employment opportunities, compromise their eligibility for government services, and set back their social lives. Juvenile offender records are permanently sealed, unlike publicly accessible adult conviction records. Based on provisions in 46 other states, cases involving young people 18 years old and under were heard in the juvenile system and 16- and 17-year-olds were not charged in the adult courts for misdemeanors or certain felonies. Youths charged with more serious crimes like armed robbery would have their cases heard in a juvenile court first before a possible transfer to the adult system. The reason for keeping young people out of the adult courts is this: The juvenile justice system allows young offenders to “age out” of extreme behaviors in a controlled and supportive environment. That window closes when teens face assaults, solitary confinement, and other types of physical and emotional abuse that are prevalent in adult facilities. There are physiological reasons as well: The adult brain does not reach full maturity until around age 25—which explains why teenagers gravitate toward sensation-seeking behaviors like theft. With the legislature committed to penalizing young people, Winston-Salem social services organizations have been moving in a different direction. William Lassiter, North Carolina’s deputy secretary of the Division of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (JJPD) had helped craft the RTA reforms to reduce juvenile recidivism rates and provide a cost-effective alternative catering to the unique developmental needs of teenagers.",

To be sure, the international’s general board voted by a 13-to-3 margin to affirm O’Brien’s clear preference for a position that would require the union to avoid having to campaign for Kamala Harris and against Donald Trump.

They used a taser on the man; it did not slow him down. The man flashed a knife. The officers shot and wounded four people: the alleged fare evader, one officer, and two bystanders, a middle-aged man and a young woman.

The incident is a tragic but not shocking product of New York City’s aggressive crackdown on fare evasion and subway crime.

It should not have been. Inflation in August was down to an annual rate of 2.5 percent, and labor markets are showing some softness.

If the group really wanted to show it was serious about encouraging executives to run their companies with a focus on the long term, “it should reconsider its 30-year-old decision to declare maximizing value for shareholders as the sole purpose of a corporation,” Pearlstein wrote.",

You can read it for yourself here. Skocpol, who teaches at Harvard, unpacks the Republican undermining of democracy into several elements. The first she calls “McConnellism”: using legal hardball to “stretch existing laws and rules to disadvantage partisan opponents.” The second approach “targets political competitors and government operations with extralegal harassment, threats of violence, even actual violence.”\n\nMore from Robert Kuttner\n\nAll of this intensified under Trump, but the trend predates Trump, and will almost surely outlive him. Those who hope for a post-Trump reversion to your father’s Republican Party are likely to be disappointed. Skocpol helpfully includes a chart, dating from 2000 to 2024, with 18 examples of legal hardball, beginning with the Supreme Court’s dubious 5-4 decision to stop the Florida recount, handing the presidency to George W. Bush (who very likely lost); and another seven examples of illegal violence, most notably but not exclusively the events of January 6, 2021. She says:\n\nLegal hardball developments include partisan-targeted changes in rules about voting, ballot access, and procedures for counting ballots or certifying elections. This category also encompasses targeted efforts to undercut the organizational capacities of partisan opponents (such as those intended to disable labor unions) or to remove longstanding powers of a public office (for instance, laws taking powers from a newly elected governor of the other party) [and] steps taken to move policy decisions from electorally accountable to nonelectoral venues (for instance, by shifting final say to courts controlled by co-partisans).",

Today the Senate will vote on the Right to IVF Act, which would make fertility treatments a federal right enshrined in law. It would supersede state court actions (like the one that was briefly in place in Alabama before the legislature nullified it) that ban in vitro fertilization as part of broader efforts to treat embryos as human beings. The Senate voted on this same bill in June, and all but two Republicans (including vice-presidential candidate J.D. Vance) voted against it, thereby preventing it from overcoming a filibuster. “Republicans can’t claim to be pro-family only to block protections for IVF,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said in a floor speech last week. “The American people deserve another chance to see if Republicans are for access to IVF or against it. It’s that simple.”\n\nSince the Republican vote in June, Donald Trump, still trying to extricate himself from the backlash against the Supreme Court’s revocation of Roe v. Wade, endorsed a concept of a plan that would have the government pay for IVF treatments, or mandate that insurance companies cover it. An insurance mandate is actually part of the Right to IVF Act; a provision of the bill titled the Access to Fertility Treatment and Care Act states that “A group health plan or a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage shall provide coverage for fertility treatment, if such plan or coverage provides coverage for obstetrical services.” That section also limits cost-sharing for IVF and other fertility treatments.",

The coverage of the first, on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania, where the would-be assassin was able to gain a clear sight line on a rooftop outside the Secret Service security perimeter, emphasized the failure of the Secret Service to coordinate with local law enforcement. The director of the Secret Service, Kimberly Cheatle, disgraced by the near miss, resigned. Investigations are still under way.

The coverage has pointed to the fact that Trump’s security detail is smaller than that of a sitting president and does not cover the entire golf course.

The loophole, whereby packages valued at under $800 can bypass customs duty-free, was initially intended to save tourists from paperwork hassles when bringing home souvenirs.

It makes consumer product safety compliance, trade enforcement of any kind, and even accurate estimation of the trade deficit impossible. Shein and Temu, two Chinese discount e-commerce companies, directly ship hundreds of millions of cheap fast-fashion items per year, accounting for the majority of de minimis shipments. Their recent ascent has spurred the shuttering of 18 yarn-spinning and clothing factories in the U.S., to say nothing of the impact on local retailers. Credible concerns that Shein and Temu use forced labor to produce their goods could also mean that de minimis is obstructing enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.

To union-friendly Democrats, the rejection of a previous bid from Cleveland-Cliffs—an American steelmaker that has good relations with its unions and makes a decent profit to boot—was emblematic of U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt’s unabashed union-loathing, making his effort to unload the company to Nippon a deliberate affront to USS’s employees.

Kamala Harris, on the other hand, did an excellent job letting Trump hang himself on his own rope. Her ability to articulate the policy of her potential administration was more mixed. On economics, the campaign still has some work to do in articulating a coherent vision for working Americans.

The most worrying moment of the debate was Trump repeating J.D. Vance’s outrageous lies about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, eating household pets, It’s a problem that racist conspiracy theories circulated by dark corners of the internet can be eagerly spread through Donald Trump’s enormous platform, targeting groups of people and encouraging racist violence.

And it finally culminated on Thursday, with a groundbreaking order throwing Navient out of the student loan system. Navient will not be allowed to directly service any student loans, and it can no longer acquire older student loans that are traded in private marketplaces, except under certain contractual requirements. “Today’s action ensures that the company can never creep back into a federal contract,” said CFPB director Rohit Chopra in a press call on Thursday.

Both President Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump were well known. Both men were unpopular. And both had records that could be easily contrasted. Unfortunately for Trump, Biden quit 106 days before the actual election. The rematch was over. The Democrats coalesced around a new candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris. This is now a contest between a former president and an incumbent vice president. The race is open. And open races favor the out party—in this case, Republicans. But Trump is special. He is universally known. He is viscerally disliked by half the country and fiercely supported by the other half. He lived in the White House less than four years ago. He has been a force in presidential politics since 2011 and has sat at the center of global politics since 2015. He's the only man to have won the Republican presidential nomination three times in a row. From a certain angle, then, Trump is now the \"incumbent.\" Harris is a comparatively youthful and fresh alternative. She is running, despite her record and involvement in Biden's failed presidency, as a change candidate. Look at what she tells audiences: \"We are not going back.\" It's working. Harris catalyzed a virtuous cycle for her party: Large and enthusiastic crowds prompt favorable press, resulting in spiking donations and favorability and support, and contributing to large and enthusiastic crowds.",

The party and its media allies deserve medals in political contortion. In the space of a few weeks, they've gone from saying that Joe Biden is the next FDR, to Biden is fine, how dare you question his age, to Biden is incapable of serving a second term, to Biden is a stubborn old man who will sink the party, to Biden is a demigod whose selflessness will be recalled for centuries. Keeping up with the changing party line is exhausting. Not long ago, remember, it was considered a slur to suggest that Joe Biden was too old and infirm to be reelected president. In June, when the Wall Street Journal published a detailed report on Biden's memory loss and confusion, the White House denounced the paper and its parent company. Biden's BFFs on MSNBC called the article \"a Trump hit piece.\" Days later, when videos circulated on social media of a stiff and vacant Biden visiting Normandy for the 80th anniversary of D-Day, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the images were \"cheap fakes\" made \"in bad faith.\" The Washington Post published a story headlined \"How Republicans Used Misleading Videos To Attack Biden in a 24-Hour Period.\" Misleading, indeed. Then, on June 27, Biden debated Donald Trump. He gave the worst debate performance in American history. His condition was broadcast to the world. Trump's polling lead grew. And the message changed. Democrats said that Biden would have to prove his viability.",

The former president's narration of the attempt on his life was gripping television. When he kissed the fireman's helmet of Corey Comperatore, the husband and father who was killed during the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, last weekend, he created an indelible image. The Trump who appeared on stage was humble, gracious, contemplative. Then, a half hour into the speech, Trump began to improvise. He talked. And talked. He was the Trump we are used to seeing on the campaign trail: garrulous and sarcastic, cracking jokes, championing his record, describing goals for a second term. At length. The speech must have set a record for longest convention address. If Trump wanted to prove he could speak with greater passion and for a longer period of time than President Biden, he did so. He also left this television viewer exhausted. The Trump who spoke for 91 minutes on Thursday evening was a slightly more subdued version of the man who has been at the center of politics for almost a decade. Yet much of the convention was spent trying to convince Americans that Trump is more than the person they've watched on the news since 2015. For example, one day after an assassin's bullet narrowly missed Donald Trump, Trump's wife Melania released a letter to the American public. In an appeal to our shared humanity, the former first lady described a side of her husband that is often hidden from the outside world. \"A monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald's passion—his laughter, ingenuity, love of music, and inspiration,\" she wrote.",

Because Biden's performance did nothing to resolve the Democratic Party's dilemma over his status as its 2024 presidential candidate. The press conference supplied Biden's internal critics with ammunition against his candidacy, such as when he misidentified Kamala Harris as \"Vice President Trump.\" But Biden's answers on foreign-policy questions were also strong enough to reassure, at least for the moment, his allies within the party. The result is that Biden lives to fight another day as the Democrats' presumptive nominee. Which is exactly what Trump wants. Since Biden's terrible debate performance on June 27, the former president has basked in the best of both worlds: Biden has struggled to put down the revolt within his party, while sinking in popularity and trailing Trump in national polling averages as well as in swing states. Prolonging the agony, with liberal media and Hollywood celebrities as well as Democratic congressmen calling for Biden's withdrawal from the ticket or abdication from office, as the president engages in a high-stakes campaign to show he is up to the job, only helps Trump's situation. Democratic divisions will remain in public view. The media's attention will be on the incumbent. And Biden is liable to commit another gaffe, misstep, or brain freeze at any moment. It's hard to see any way out for the Democrats. Stick with Biden, and he is likely to go down in defeat to Donald Trump, perhaps in an Electoral College landslide. Move against him, and then… Well, what?",

His breath was heavy, his voice was raspy and faint, his physical bearing poor. When he wasn't speaking, his mouth was agape. His answers rambled, and he was sometimes incoherent. Every so often, he coughed noticeably. He did not look well. This wasn't the hyped-up, partisan Biden who appeared at the State of the Union in March. This was the Biden who mumbled argle-bargle at the White House's Juneteenth celebration. The contrast with former president Donald Trump was apparent. Trump was confident, direct, and forceful. Unlike in 2020, he did not interrupt his opponent or the moderators. He followed the debate rules. He kept his facial expressions, and even his sarcasm, to a minimum. I have watched every Trump debate since he entered electoral politics in 2015. Thursday night was his best performance. I've missed quite a few Biden debates because of his longevity, but this was easily his worst showing since 2008. And while his answers became somewhat steadier over time, he could not overcome the visual of the split screen with Trump. On the left of television screens around the world, Trump looked like he had just stepped off the 2020 campaign trail. On the right, Biden looked like a diminished man who is not up to the job and cannot be expected to complete a second full term as president. Biden's presence confirmed that Robert Hur, the special counsel who investigated the president's handling of classified documents, was, if anything, pulling punches when he wrote that Biden is \"a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\"",

And if independents are key, then the Trump campaign may want to keep a close eye on recent polling. So far in the 2024 campaign, Donald Trump has enjoyed consistent support from independents despite losing their votes by 13 points in 2020. For example, the April New York Times/Siena poll had Trump winning likely voters overall by 1 point and likely independent voters by 4 points. The April Fox News poll of registered voters had Trump winning registered voters overall by 1 point and independent voters by 2 points. The same pattern is visible in the states. The May Bloomberg/Morning Consult poll of swing states had Trump winning independents and sweeping every battleground except Michigan. And the June Emerson poll of swing states has Trump winning independents, and registered voters overall, in every swing state from Arizona to Pennsylvania. But the Emerson poll also found that independent support for Trump has dropped. He's below 45 percent among independents in Arizona, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. That is enough to beat Biden, for now. It's not enough to put this election away. Trump also lost support from independents in the June Fox News poll. In a wild swing, independents have gone from favoring Trump by 2 points to favoring Biden by 9 points, giving the incumbent a 2-point lead among voters nationwide. These numbers suggest that Trump's felony conviction in New York City hurt his lead. Trump is still ahead in the swing states, where the election will be decided, but in most cases his margins are tight.",

That is to say: Not well at all. Blinken went to the region to pressure Israel and Hamas into accepting President Biden's latest ceasefire proposal for the war in Gaza. Biden released the plan on May 31. It would proceed in three stages. First, there would be a six-week truce during which Hamas would release some hostages in exchange for terrorists held in Israel, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would withdraw from Gaza's population centers, and Americans would supply more humanitarian aid for Gaza's Palestinians. The second phase would involve negotiations over full IDF withdrawal from Gaza and the release of the remaining captives. In the third phase, the \"international community\" would rebuild Gaza, a non-Hamas government would come to power, Saudi Arabia and Israel would make peace, and the oceans would turn into pink lemonade. I'm kidding about the lemonade. Still, there is something absurd about the offer in general. It rests on the assumption that Hamas is a legitimate negotiating partner with an interest in ending the war. Such an assumption is worse than false. It is insane. And Blinken knows it. Hamas isn't a state worthy of recognition. It's a terrorist entity governing a population through fear, terror, and zealotry. Which is why Americans deal not with Hamas but with Hamas's intermediaries in Egypt and Qatar. We still have some scruples, after all. And if a terror organization does not deserve our direct contact, then it does not deserve our rescue.",

Senior military leaders tell him that our under-resourced and overtaxed military is not prepared for the challenge. \"We struggle to build and maintain ships, our fighter jet fleet is dangerously small, and our military infrastructure is outdated,\" Wicker wrote in a widely circulated New York Times op-ed this week. Wicker's solution is a \"generational investment in the U.S. military\" that he calls \"21st Century Peace Through Strength.\" He would spend an additional $55 billion on defense in the coming fiscal year and raise overall defense spending from just under 3 percent of the U.S. economy to 5 percent by the end of this decade. Under Wicker's plan, the Pentagon would maximize its joint-force capabilities. The Navy would grow to 357 ships. The number of Air Force fighter jets would massively increase. More dollars would be spent on submarines and sub pens. \"The plan,\" Wicker wrote in the op-ed, \"would also replenish the Air Force tanker and training fleets, accelerate the modernization of the Army and Marine Corps, and invest in joint capabilities that are all too often forgotten, including logistics and munitions.\" The money can't arrive soon enough.

Nixon had won 49 states, losing Massachusetts and Washington, D.C., to Senator George McGovern (D., S.D.). He had won 61 percent of the popular vote. More striking to Buchanan than the size of this \"New American Majority\" was its composition. In addition to the traditional Republican base, Nixon had won over the South (on the presidential level) and the \"ethnic, blue-collar, Catholic, working-class Americans of the North, Midwest, and West.\" Here was Nixon's \"silent majority,\" revealed for all to see. Buchanan's fear was that this majority came into view only on Election Day. By the time votes had been tallied, he wrote, the voices of the \"liberal media\" and other left-wing social and cultural elites were again dominant. Buchanan's postelection memo set out policy objectives that he believed would block the liberals and turn Nixon into the \"Republican FDR, founder and first magistrate of a political dynasty, to dominate American politics long after the President has retired from office.\" I thought about Buchanan's memo while reading coverage of the run-up to Donald Trump's Thursday rally in the Bronx. If Trump defeats President Biden this November and becomes the first president since the 19th century to serve nonconsecutive terms, it will be because Trump, like Nixon, reconfigured the GOP coalition. He will have reclaimed Republican bastions in the South and Mountain West and captured at least one state in the Rust Belt.",

The first, at CNN headquarters on June 27, will be held before either candidate accepts his party's nomination. ABC plans on hosting the second debate on September 10. The deal was worked out by lunch. And the details were settled as well. No live audience. No open mics while the other man is speaking. No Robert F.

Shock at the suddenness of the policy reversal and the banal setting of Biden's major shift. Confusion at the incoherence of a policy that denounces anti-Semitism one day and protects Hamas the next.

His comments also raise the question of what a \"win\" against Iran would really look like—and why America has not pursued that goal. Yes, the technical and operational mastery of the U.S.-led coalition was stunning. America, Israel, the United Kingdom, France, and most significantly Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates intercepted 99 percent of the weapons that Iran launched to kill Jews.

Inflation is responsible for his dismal job approval numbers and poses the greatest risk to his presidency. Yet he may be able to overcome the challenge—if Republicans fail to persuade voters that their policies will stabilize prices and raise wages. No one said politics is easy. The return of inflation arrived during Biden's presidency and is a direct consequence of his policies. Yet inflation puts both Democrats and Republicans in a bind. Why? Because price increases reveal the inanity of liberal measures that subsidize demand while restricting supply. And because they highlight the reactive, scrambling, content-free character of many GOP campaigns. Biden is not about to change direction.

Nebraska is one of two states (the other being Maine) that splits its Electoral College votes.

The latest is ProPublica’s story of a Georgia woman who died after a North Carolina abortionist gave her chemical abortion pills — which, contrary to Democrat narratives, are unsafe. The article, however, pretends the death was caused by Georgia’s pro-life laws. The author of the story repeatedly attempts to conflate a procedure used to treat miscarriages, dilation and curettage (D&C), with elective abortion. In ProPublica’s telling, 28-year-old Amber Nicole Thurman had ingested the chemical abortion pill regimen, which consists of the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol. Mifepristone ends the life of the developing human being; misoprostol helps achieve complete expulsion of the embryo. It’s worth noting that the FDA’s 2000 approval of mifepristone acknowledged its risks and enacted safety requirements, including a seven-week gestational limit, requiring women to see a physician in person, and a mandatory one-time post-abortion appointment to confirm that the uterus was empty and that bleeding had subsided. The FDA also required manufacturers of the abortion pill to report all adverse health events that were reported to them, such as infection or excessive bleeding — not just patient deaths. But thanks to Democrat efforts to relax safety requirements for abortion pills, important safeguards no longer apply. When Thurman experienced “complications” from the abortion, which ProPublica wrongly asserts are “rare,” she went to the hospital for a D&C. While ProPublica claims, “Thurman had told doctors her miscarriage was not spontaneous — it was the result of taking pills to terminate her pregnancy,” Thurman was not experiencing a miscarriage.",

Earlier this month, the Piñon Post, a conservative state paper, reported on a new commercial campaign attempting to spoil Democrats’ expectation to maintain the state’s five electoral votes for Kamala Harris and reelect Sen. Martin Heinrich. The ads from a group called Election Freedom, Inc., attack Heinrich and Harris over inflation and the incumbent border crisis. Derek Dufresne, a consultant for the 501(c)(4) political advocacy group, told The Federalist the New Mexico campaign was “a significant, seven-figure investment,” but did not provide an exact total. “We are running an aggressive, complete, issue-based campaign focusing on the significant policy failures of Kamala Harris and Martin Heinrich, which will continue through November,” Dufresne said. The ads highlight high food, energy, and mortgage costs in a border state overwhelmed by migration. Another ad campaign from the group Frontiers of Freedom Action (FFA) targets Heinrich as one of three western senators hit by a multi-state media blitz highlighting Democrats’ anti-Catholic bigotry. The ads aired in both English and Spanish to target southwestern Hispanics disillusioned by the Democrats’ extremism, which conflicts with religious liberty. “When Hispanic voters — especially Hispanics who attend Catholic Mass — come to learn about their senator’s record of anti-Catholic bigotry, they are going to be stunned,” George Landrith, the group’s president, said in a press release. “Republicans too often forget that even though many Hispanic voters are moving towards Trump, they are likely to vote for incumbent members of Congress just because they know their names,” Landrith added.",

It was a simpler time, when MTV actually played music videos. Thrilled by its accomplishment of activating “millions of young people” to turn out to the polls, the leftist nonprofit has parlayed its GOTV successes into a multitude of leftist causes over its 30-plus years in operation — even as targeting the young adult vote remained central to its efforts. “The group claims to be nonpartisan, but has produced videos throughout the years using celebrities who largely endorse a left-of-center agenda, including abortion rights, liberalizing criminal justice policy, and marijuana legalization,” non-profit tracker InfluenceWatch reports.",

The names of the justices targeted, however, were withheld by the Department of Justice — likely because they confirm Democrats’ incendiary rhetoric against the conservative members of the court is working. The DOJ announced on Thursday that Panos Anastasiou faces nine counts of making threats against a federal judge and 13 counts of making threats in interstate commerce after he sent more than 465 messages pledging harm against justices via “a public website the court maintained.”\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland acknowledged in the Thursday press release that the communications were rooted in Anastasiou’s desire to “retaliate against them for decisions he disagreed with.” Yet, neither he nor the Department of Justice memo announcing the arrest identified exactly which of the nine SCOTUS members and their family members were terrorized. In fact, the DOJ went out of its way in its 11-page September 18 indictment of Anastasiou to disguise which high bench presiders were in danger for upholding their constitutional duties by reducing the justices to numbers “1-6.” Six of the nine sitting SCOTUS justices were nominated to the high bench by Republican presidents. The document accusing the Alaskan of several felonies, however, shows Anastasiou’s threats were well timed not only with a Democrat-manufactured ethics scandal, but also decisions secured specifically by the court’s conservative majority. In May, as corporate media ramped up Democrat-manufactured attacks on Republican-nominated justices like Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, Anastasiou promised “lynching” for the unnamed “Justice 1,” who he previously demanded “hang[]…from an Oak tree,” and swore he would end “Justice 2” and his family’s lives by “putting a bullet in his […] head.” Additionally, Anastasiou expressed hope that Justices 1 and 2 and their families would be killed by “‘fellow veterans’ who ‘spray’ their homes with bullets.”\n\nHours after SCOTUS ruled 6 to 3 on July 1 that presidents have “absolute immunity” for “actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority” and “at least presumptive immunity” for all “official acts,” Anastasiou threatened to “murder,” “torture,” and “execute” six of the justices with “intent to impede, intimidate, and interfere” with the court’s decision-making authority.",

Daycare workers who participated in an April training from the tax-funded organization Wisconsin Early Childhood Association (WECA) received “diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging” kits worth $600 each that included board books teaching babies race hatred and gender dysphoria. The kit came to light this week when a daycare owner who received one went public with what she found inside. In the training, an author of three of the books in the kit, Megan Madison, told daycare workers that “the color-blind approach” to race “is ineffective and potentially harmful.” Madison cohosted the training with WECA’s diversity director, Tanya Johnson. Any organization that receives federal funds risks violating federal antidiscrimination law by disparaging Americans based on their race, said Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty attorney Dan Lennington. WECA is essentially a clearing house for taxpayer funds, directing it to daycares for food welfare, daycare worker training, and more. Johnson opened the training by stating her pronouns and giving a “land acknowledgment” that asserted parts of the United States actually belong to tribal peoples whom U.S. armed forces conquered long ago. “We respectfully acknowledge the land on which we are holding this training, the traditional land of Ho-Chunk Nation,” she claimed. “Today we recognize and honor with gratitude both the land and the indigenous people who live and who continue to live on the land now called the United States.”\n\nMadison, who led the training with Johnson, thanked Johnson for the land acknowledgment and claimed she lives “on Lenape land,” or what everyone knows to be New York City.",

Never shy to provide relevant examples, LGBT media demonstrated their dedication to hypocrisy and hierarchy just this week. In a glowing interview with President Joe Biden, the Washington Blade, a legacy LGBT news source, gasped, “Writing about President Joe Biden’s legacy is difficult without the distance and time required to assess a leader of his stature, but what becomes clear from talking with him is the extent to which his views on LGBTQ rights come from the heart.”\n\nFrom there it would seem Biden was the single greatest gift to LGBT-identifying Americans, honoring his administration as the most pro-LGBT in American history. Speaking of LGBT Americans, Biden said, “[M]ost of the openly gay people that have worked with me, that I’ve worked with, the one advantage they have is they tend to have more courage than most people have.”\n\nBiden has the greatest “respect and admiration” for LGBT people. He argued, “[A]ll the LGBTQ+ people that have worked for me or with me have reinforced my view that it’s not what your sexual preference is, it’s what your intellectual capacity is and what your courage is.”\n\nBut wait a minute. Did Biden just refer to LGBT people as having a “sexual preference?” In 2020, when then-Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett innocently uttered the same phrase, it became a national controversy. LGBTQ Nation, using that quote as its subheading for an article praising the president, demanded in 2020, “Barrett used the offensive phrase ‘sexual preference,’ a right-wing dog-whistle that suggests that LGBTQ people can be cured.”\n\nThe use of this phrase, the site argued in its headline, “revealed how biased she is against LGBTQ people.” Barrett used the phrase when saying, “I have no agenda and I do want to be clear that I have never discriminated on the basis of sexual preference and would not ever discriminate on the basis of sexual preference.” Yet this was sufficient to generate outrage headlines in not only LGBT media but across all major news organizations.",

The second book in the Jack Zulu series, Jack Zulu and the Girl with Golden Wings, is a compelling, action-packed fantasy, wherein strong, Christian characters fight to overpower evil and destructive forces intent on overtaking the worlds. Crafted by seasoned storyteller, author S.D. Smith of the bestselling Green Ember series, and his son J.C. Smith, the Girl with Golden Wings picks up two years after the first book in the series, Jack Zulu and the Waylander’s Key, ends. While Jack has officially earned hero status in the Wayland, the world between worlds that connects his small hometown of Myrtle, West Virginia to lands undiscovered by many earth-walkers, he is still riddled with self-doubt and despondency over his internal struggles with pride and power. Jack’s struggle is amplified by greater self-discovery. He learns that his choices directly impact the future and destiny of the worlds, and he must carve out his own path to fulfill an unforeseen purpose, without the guidance and strong hand of his father, whose death remains shrouded in mystery. Jack joins an entourage traveling through the war-torn world of Thandalia, where legends of miraculous healing and tremendous valor are overshadowed by the destruction and tyranny proliferated by Rancast, a human who has acquired god-like powers and destroys everything that stands in the way of his quest for total and absolute rule.",

Unfortunately, prosecutors and federal officials are still tallying up the damage. The House Oversight Committee recently released a report summarizing its own findings on the proliferation of pandemic scams. While other federal analyses have focused on the effects at the federal level, the committee report showed how incompetence at the state level, where unemployment benefits actually get administered, sowed the seeds for the Covid-era grifts. Invitation to Criminals\n\nThe House investigation examined how numerous state decisions made identity fraud and other scams a near-certainty. For instance, the report references this nugget from a federal Justice Department press release announcing that a married couple had agreed to plead guilty to wire fraud charges:\n\nAccording to court documents, Tiffany [Pacheco] was hired by the Massachusetts Department of Unemployment Assistance (DUA) in April 2020, shortly after her release from federal prison following a conviction for aggravated identity theft. While employed by DUA, Tiffany allegedly misused her position to submit fraudulent [unemployment] claim information on behalf of herself and her husband, Arthur, who was incarcerated in Texas until September 4, 2020, and thus ineligible for [unemployment] funds. (Emphasis mine.) The only natural response consists of one word: Really? One can read that paragraph over and over again to try to make sense of it — a government agency hiring someone just out of prison after a federal identity fraud conviction and placing her in a position with access to names, Social Security numbers, and other personal information allowing said individual to engage in more identity theft.",

Sadly, too often, the debate devolves quickly into partisan talking points. The Biden-Harris administration seized on this tragedy to call for more laws that would restrict Americans’ right to self-defense, but which would have done nothing to stop this shooting. In fact, at both the federal and state levels, it is already illegal for a 14-year-old to purchase and possess a firearm, but, neither those laws nor others, like the Gun-Free School Zones Act, deterred this evil. More recently on the debate stage, Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris attempted to amend her clear anti-gun record, despite previously voicing support for confiscating guns as a candidate in 2020. It’s crucial to set politics aside and approach this debate with facts. The reality is that many of our schools remain soft targets, vulnerable to those intent on causing harm. “Gun-free zone” signs offer false security, deterring only the law-abiding. We need a multifaceted strategy that hardens schools as targets while empowering responsible adults to protect themselves and those in their care. A cornerstone of this approach should be allowing trained, willing school staff to carry concealed firearms. To be clear, this isn’t about forcing guns into unwilling hands but about giving educators a choice. Law enforcement or even trained security personnel cannot be everywhere simultaneously, and when seconds matter, even a tiny percentage of armed staff can make a difference. Armed Educators and Security Officers\n\nThis strategy has already been implemented successfully in numerous school districts across the country.",

Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said these voters “lean more heavily Republican” and are between 45-60 years old, as reported in the Votebeat article. In Arizona, voters registering via state registration form must provide documentary proof of citizenship (DPOC) to vote in state and local races. Those who are unable to provide such proof are registered as “federal-only” voters and can only cast ballots in federal races.

Gavin Newsom for state prohibitions that prevent schools from telling parents about student requests to identify as a different gender without the student’s consent. In July, the state’s far-left governor signed Assembly Bill 1955, which bars school officials from notifying parents when their children go by different names or request to use bathrooms for the opposite sex unless the children consent to the notification. The bill further bars any policy that would require schools to inform parents of their child’s gender “transition.” The pro-Trump legal foundation, America First Legal, filed a lawsuit Wednesday to challenge the law on behalf of California parents and the City of Huntington Beach, which has been resisting Sacramento radicalism since conservatives captured a majority on the town council two years ago. “This law violates the 14th Amendment, which guarantees the rights of parents to make decisions about their minor children regarding all medical treatment — in this case, social ‘transitioning,’” the nonprofit said in a press release. “Fit parents are presumed to act in the best interest of their child. The government cannot intervene in their relationship simply because it does not like the parents’ decision.”\n\nThe California law is the first of its kind at the statewide level, as many parents grapple with whether to remain on the West Coast given the hostility toward parents who protest radical gender policy. Last year, California Republican state Sen. Scott Wilk bluntly recommended parents “flee” to keep their children. “In the past when we’ve had these discussions and I’ve seen parental rights atrophy, I’ve encouraged people to keep fighting,” Wilk said.",

Now running with the unprecedented endorsement of a legacy Kennedy, the Trump family may soon reclaim White House authority and with it the opportunity to pick up where former First Lady Michelle Obama left off. Childhood obesity represents one of the few issues on which the new Republican White House can reclaim moral authority and also galvanize a bipartisan political movement with a major push to end this destructive epidemic. When the Obama family came into office, the epidemic of childhood obesity catalyzed what at first had seemed an optimistic initiative to tackle the health care crisis plaguing our children. By 2009, nearly 17 percent of children aged 2-19 were obese, representing a striking increase from just 5 percent in 1971. In 2017, the number had grown even higher, with more than 19 percent of children in America, or nearly 1 in 5, struggling with obesity. The number of kids and teens coping with “severe obesity” reached 6 percent for the first time ever by 2013, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The first lady’s movement obviously failed, and the campaign did so for two probable reasons: 1) half the country wrote off the celebrity-infused campaign as an unserious example of nanny-state finger-wagging from elites in D.C., and 2) a conspiracy of food and pharmaceutical interests successfully undermined the program.

And they expected that the time they needed to outlast the Israeli offensive would be provided to them by Israel's closest ally.

Over the next several months, as Israel's counter-offensive into Gaza began, the United States played a double game. On the one hand, Washington continued to supply Jerusalem with munitions badly needed by the IDF. Eventually, however, it was reported that the Pentagon slow-walked its delivery to maintain leverage over the Israelis. While the public pressure on Israel was bad, even worse was the duress the administration was employing against Netanyahu behind the scenes as it sought to delay every Israeli effort at finishing off the terrorists.

        "text": "The Only Deal Hamas Wants: Israel's Surrender Abandoning the border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt would enable Hamas to carry on with its decades-long practice of smuggling weapons into the enclave. It would also allow the new head of Hamas, Yahya Sinwar, to escape – along with many of the hostages with whom he is thought to be surrounding himself for protection -- through the tunnels into Egypt's Sinai Desert. The most recent statement from Hamas makes it clear that the terror group wants Israel to leave the Gaza Strip before any hostages are freed. According to some reports, Hamas has stated that it is willing to free the hostages in stages. It undoubtedly wants to hold on to as many hostages as possible as an \"insurance policy\" that Israel will not resume the war against the terror group and that the terrorist group will be able to have a free hand to attack Israel in the future. This implies that a large number of the hostages remain captive in the hands of the terror group for years. It is important to note that for the past 10 years, Hamas has been holding hostage two Israeli civilians who are believed to be still alive, as well as the remains of two IDF soldiers. Hamas is willing to fight to the last Palestinian. The terror group does not care if tens of thousands of its own people lose their lives as a result of the war it began. Its No. 1 priority is to hold on to power after the war. Hamas is evidently hoping that a ceasefire-hostage deal will help it achieve its goal of retaining control over the Gaza Strip.",

Their obstinacy and the raising of the Hamas flag inside the parliament have provoked an anti-Islam backlash opposed to Houellebecq and Kepel's forecasts. Thus, France isn't going to have an extremist president next year. What has happened is that ultra-nationalist groups have seized the opportunity to portray themselves as the only bulwark against an \"aggressive Islam\" with the catchword \"immigration\" that causes \"insecurity.\" It was only a generation ago that France, or at least the opinion-making elite, had a quite different image of Islam. At that time, Islam was seen as a deeply spiritual discipline best explained by mystics such as Ibn al-Arabi and poets such as Roumi. The soft image that French Islamologues created was used by militant Islamists, including the Muslim Brotherhood, the Khomeinists of Iran and Lebanon, remnants of the Algerian Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) and more recently ISIS to cast themselves as \"victims\" of colonialism, imperialism and even racism and avoid close scrutiny, while they built no-go fiefdoms around Paris and provincial centers to promote ideologies far from Ibn al-Arabi and Roumi; let alone St. Aldebert and Meister Eckhart. Between 1980 and 2020, the French state spent more than $30 billion in its \"Islamic\" suburbs in the hope of preventing what Macron describes as \"separatism.\"",

By turning a blind eye to the actions of the Iranian regime's while releasing roughly $100 billion to the treasury of the mullahs, the Biden-Harris administration is responsible for empowering these entities.

While Lammy's anti-Israel policies will undoubtedly appeal to the Labour's Party's hard-Left, they are also likely to place Starmer's government on a collision course with Washington, which has concluded there are no grounds for suspending arms deals with Israel, and that the creation of Palestinian state, as agreed in the Oslo Accords, is contingent on successful peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians. His appeal came shortly after a cell of al-Qaeda terrorists had carried out their worst terrorist attack against the UK with the London bombings in July 2005, murdering 72 innocent commuters and wounding more than 700. As a junior minister in Tony Blair's government in 2006, for example, the Harvard-educated Lammy called for the British media to provide a platform for them to air their \"poisonous\" views. Lammy has now added to his anti-Israel stance by suspending a number of UK arms contracts to Israel, a decision that was announced on the same day that Israel buried the latest group of hostages to be murdered by Hamas terrorists, a decision that was denounced by Netanyahu as \"shameful\". At the same time, Lammy confirmed that the UK was to restore its funding to UNRWA, the UN agency responsible for supporting Palestinian refugees, after support for the organisation was withdrawn by a number of countries -- including the US -- over claims its staffers were directly involved in the October 7 attacks carried out by Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists against Israel.",

The assumption back then was that if you bring Arafat's PLO from the Arab countries to Gaza and the West Bank and help them create a government and police force, the Palestinians would renounce terrorism and give up their dream of destroying Israel. The Palestinian Authority, established in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1994, had no intention of making peace with Israel, and still has not. Palestinian leaders continue to praise terrorists as \"martyrs\" and \"heroes\" and pay monthly salaries to their families. Many Israeli \"elites\" chose to turn a blind eye to the Palestinian leaders' support for terrorism and incitement of violence and hatred against Israel. Some Israeli peace activists continued to argue that Abbas who, since 2014 has refused to resume peace negotiations with Israel, is somehow a credible peace partner. \"He [Arafat] did not negotiate in good faith; indeed, he did not negotiate at all. He just kept saying no to every offer, never making any counterproposals of his own.\" – Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, quoted by Benny Morris from interviews in late March and early April 2202.

Their core claim is that Netanyahu is prolonging the war and condemning the hostages to death solely to appease extremists in his coalition and thus remain in power. Of course, everyone desperately wants the hostages brought back home. But the idea that the ceasefire deal would achieve this is sheer fantasy. Only a few of the hostages would be released in the first phase. Hamas would then use the ceasefire to regroup and rearm, spinning out the continuing negotiation farce to keep the rest of the hostages trapped and thus retain control of the Gaza Strip. It would only ever release all the hostages (if at all) with Israel's total surrender. That's what those calling for an immediate ceasefire deal are actually promoting. The only way to save the hostages is through military pressure. That's one reason why it's imperative for Israel to retain control of the Philadelphi corridor, the area of Gaza that borders Egypt. The importance of this corridor cannot be exaggerated. Israel's capture of it has uncovered deep below its surface an extensive infrastructure of giant tunnels into Egypt — thus revealing the principal route through which Hamas imported its rockets, weapons and ammunition.

PD-59 was a plan to decimate the command and control and communications structure of the Soviet Union, along with its nuclear weapons systems, in a counterforce first strike, thus depriving the USSR of second-strike capability. While this secret plan was being put into place, Washington was publicly declaring its intention to install hundreds of intermediate-range Pershing II and cruise missiles in Europe. This was ostensibly in response to the Russian development of a mid-range nuclear missile, the SS-20. But it was actually, as PD-59 indicated, directed at preparing for a “limited” nuclear war, utilizing counterforce weapons and based on the development of a first-strike capability. In December 1979, the U.S. Senate refused to ratify the SALT II Treaty limiting strategic nuclear weapons, ostensibly on the grounds of the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan (a trap for the Soviets initiated by Brzezinski in another secret plan directed at mobilizing the Mujahideen in Afghanistan—with dire long-term consequences that were to stretch into the present century) (“Jimmy Carter’s Controversial Nuclear Targeting Directive PD-509 Declassified” [Documents], Nuclear Vault, National Security Archive, George Washington University, September 14, 2012; William Burr, “How to Fight a Nuclear War,” Foreign Policy, September 14, 2012; “1998 Interview with Zbigniew Brzezinski on Afghanistan in Le Nouvel Observateur,” University of Arizona, dgibbs.arizona.edu).",

If we had a left-progressive political party in this country, what kind of economic policy should it be advocating? Most economists of the kind we assume would belong to such a party seem to think its focus should be public investment in the country’s infrastructure, with payment coming from some combination of borrowing and higher taxes on those who were the chief beneficiaries of the regressive tax reforms of the 1980s. The purpose would be to put an end to the recession and hasten the arrival of the next cyclical upswing. Many of these economists of course are in favor of long-term reforms of various kinds, but they seem to be unanimous in believing that now is not the time to divert attention from the urgent task of getting the economy going again. We think this is a short-sighted and self-defeating position. If and when the economy starts expanding again, interest in any kind of reform will abate, and conservative warnings against rocking the boat will become more persuasive. The time to raise questions about the need for fundamental change is when things are going badly and people are receptive. This is not to argue against immediate measures to relieve the suffering inflicted on a growing section of the population by the continuation, and quite likely the deepening, of the current recession.

Microfinance has become a salient sector for poverty reduction in the developing world since its inception in the 1980s. By recruiting women into a group and making this entity a contract for continuous credit, microfinance includes many people who are beyond the reach of the formal bank sector due to a lack of formal guarantees for financial services. The group meets regularly to pay the debt and women supervise each other in handing in the money each time. This model provides loans at a rate higher than the formal bank but lower than the informal lender, making it workable as a business, as well as seemingly inclusive. Furthermore, it claims to empower women since it provides credit directly to women, making them protagonists in that respect. The United Nations advocates for this model. The inventor of the model, Muhammad Yunus, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006. Nowadays, the worldwide industry has grown to be valued at $200 billion. It is also estimated that it will reach a size of $506 billion by 2030.1\n\nAs an industry prominent in the development sector, microfinance has always been controversial. In the context of India, where the industry reaches sixty million people, microfinance is justified by the central bank for its “financial inclusion.” However, the industry is also believed to apply coercion toward those who are unable to pay the debt, leading to peasant suicides.",

As Hans Koning wrote in his book Nineteen Sixty-Eight, “That blocked car, one of the organizers told us, had been like the stuff of childhood dreams of glory.” Out of it arose the Berkeley Free Speech Movement and “the very idea of ‘Berkeley’ between quotes which would reach around the world.” On December 2–3, 1964, eight hundred Berkeley students occupied the central administration building until arrested by police. According to a journalist who covered the movement, “It wasn’t exactly that Berkeley was the first place where this mechanism kicked in [political protest] but it was the place where it went critical” (“Free Speech Movement,” Bancroft Library Oral History Center, University of California, Berkeley, berkeley.edu; Hans Koning, Nineteen-Sixty Eight: A Personal Report [New York: Norton, 1987], 20; John Bellamy Foster, “The Spirit of ’68,” Monthly Review 41, no. 7 [December 1989]: 47–54—much of the text in the following paragraphs draws on Foster’s article).

It originated in the writings of Karl Haushofer, the leading German geopolitical theorist, in his 1924 Geopolitics of the Pacific Ocean and numerous other works.1 Haushofer was a German military attaché in Japan in 1908–1909, and traveled widely in East Asia. As a result of these experiences, he was to emerge as a major geopolitical analyst. He served as a brigade commander in the First World War, rising to the rank of major general by the war’s end. Rudolf Hess, who had been Haushofer’s aide-de-camp and later his student, was one of his chief disciples. In 1920, Hess joined the Nazi Party. Following the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch, when Adolf Hitler and Hess were confined to the prison in the Fortress of Landsberg, Haushofer instructed both of them in geopolitics, while Hitler dictated Mein Kampf to Hess. A decade later, when Hitler came to power in Germany, Hess was appointed Deputy Führer of the Nazi Party. A special professorship in defense geography was created for Haushofer at the University of Munich.2\n\nThe designation of the Indo-Pacific as a geopolitical region arose in Haushofer’s global imperial strategy, aimed at carving out a new “Pan-region” (similar to Pan-America under U.S. hegemony) in the Far East, to be led by Germany, Japan, and Russia/USSR.",

Evolution of the U.S. “Indo-Pacific Strategy”\n\nAs independent geographical units, the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean have been separated for a long time. With the advent of the era of great navigation, biogeographic and ethnographic studies have combined the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, and thus the two have been integrated into a marine ecosystem. Since then, the spread of geopolitical discourse has gradually transformed the Indian-Pacific Ocean from a biogeographical region to a geostrategic one.1\n\nSince the beginning of the twenty-first century, as the strategic position of the Indian-Pacific region has continued to be elevated, the term Indo-Pacific has emerged, triggering attention and discussion in academic and strategic circles. It is generally believed that the first official use of the broad notion of a geopolitical confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans was made by the late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. In August 2007, Abe called for a “broader Asia” spanning the Pacific and Indian Oceans—“seas of freedom and prosperity, which will be open and transparent to all”—in a speech to the Indian Parliament.2 Although Abe did not explicitly mention the concept of the Indo-Pacific, he provided the initial inspiration for U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy. On November 10, 2017, while attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Business Leaders’ Summit in Vietnam, then U.S. President Donald Trump formally proposed to build a “free and open Indo-Pacific.”3 In December 2017, the Trump administration released the National Security Strategy of the United States of America, making it clear that “Indo-Pacific” specifically refers to the super-region stretching from the west coast of India to the Pacific shores of the United States.4 In February 2018, Trump signed the U.S. Strategic Framework for the Indo-Pacific, formulated by the U.S. National Security Council as the strategic goal and action guide of the United States in the Indo-Pacific region.",

In the Western imagination, Taiwan exists as little more than a staging ground for ideological war with the People’s Republic of China (PRC)—a crossroads of democracy versus authoritarianism, Western values versus Chinese backwardness, and free market capitalism versus closed-door communism. Yet for centuries, the island of Taiwan has played a rich and pivotal role in broader Chinese history. Located just one hundred miles from the mainland’s southeastern coast, Taiwan was linked to the mainland through migration, trade, language, and culture long before European and Japanese colonizers seized on its strategic location as a launchpad for economic and military forays against China at large. Today, this history continues as U.S. imperialism positions Taiwan as an ideological and military base for its new Cold War against China.1\n\nTaiwan’s separation from the Chinese mainland began in 1895, when the Qing government was forced to cede Taiwan to Japan after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War. While Japan’s surrender at the end of the Second World War legally restored Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan, the Chinese Civil War and the global Cold War once again rendered Taiwan an instrument for imperial ambitions against China. For the ascendant postwar United States, the 1949 establishment of the PRC under the Communist Party of China (CPC) marked the “loss of China”—a blow only partially recouped by propping up the fleeing Chiang Kai-shek government in Taiwan as “Free China.” In 1950, as the United States waged war to prevent the socialist unification of Korea, President Harry S. Truman dispatched the U.S. Navy’s Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait to similarly foreclose the possibility of a unified socialist China.",

He has traveled to North and South Korea and is chair of the NZ-DPRK Society. His website, Asian Geopolitics, has more information and links to his recent publications. General Paul LaCamera, testifying before the U.S. House of Representatives Armed Services Committee on March 20, 2024, stated:\n\nThe U.S.-ROK [United States-Republic of Korea] Alliance serves as a linchpin for peace and prosperity in Northeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific. Our two nations share common values and democratic norms, value human rights, and abide by the rules-based international order. We also share significant economic and cultural ties that benefit both nations. The ROK sits at the heart of Northeast Asia, a region of significant security and economic interest for the United States. The presence of U.S. forces in the ROK and Japan demonstrates our ironclad commitment to the people of Korea and protects our strategic interests in Northeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific region.1\n\nStripping aside the cant, what LaCamera is saying is that Korea is the linchpin of U.S. strategy in Northeast Asia, and thus across the Indo-Pacific. This strategy is aimed at preserving and expanding U.S. hegemony by containing China and Russia, and destroying them as challenges to U.S. domination. Admittedly, LaCamera is Commander of U.S. Forces in (South) Korea, and so has reason to exaggerate the importance of Korea, but geography does support his assertion.",

In his New Year’s address on January 15, 2024, North Korean Workers’ Party Chairman Kim Jong-un proposed removing from North Korea’s socialist constitution the notions of South and North Koreans as compatriots and the pursuit of peaceful reunification.1 Furthermore, he argued that North Korea’s education should teach students that South Korea is the North’s main enemy state.2 While denying that this was an announcement for reunification through preemptive attack, Kim stated that if war broke out, North Korea would occupy, subjugate, and reclaim South Korea.3 This speech severed ties with the more than thirty years of peaceful reunification pursued by North Korea’s two previous leaders. Since the early 1990s, North Korea has sought the normalization of relations with the United States and peaceful reunification with South Korea. During that time, inter-Korean relations ebbed and flowed. But North Korea’s changed inter-Korean policy moves away from peaceful reunification and toward war in the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia. If we are to chart our way back to peace, we must understand the motivations that led to such a shift and the historical and geopolitical processes that have led us to our current moment: the failed peace negotiations with the United States, the historical and social limits of South Korean politics, and the intensifying polarization of Northeast Asia due to U.S. military escalation. Abolitionist Frederick Douglass famously said that “power concedes nothing without a demand.”4 Peace movements must organize around a common set of demands against war: opposing the U.S. military escalation that is dividing the region into camps; overcoming the structural limitations of South Korea that keeps it dependent upon the United States; and coalescing frontline struggles within South Korea and the region into a common struggle against U.S. military escalations.",

He serves as a contributing editor for IndoPROGRESS, a media collective connecting progressive scholars and activists in Indonesia. Popularly known as a region of high growth and emerging multilateralism, the Indo-Pacific has become a new hotspot of geopolitical tensions between the United States, with its imperial ambitions, and China as an emerging global power.1 Perhaps the most recent and vivid illustration of this tension can be found in Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s address to the U.S. Congress in April of this year, in which he proclaimed the necessity of U.S. leadership in championing “freedom and democracy” and cautioned against the rise of China as “the greatest strategic challenge…to the peace and stability of the international community at large.”2 This assertion, ironically, came at a time when the United States and the Western bloc continue their military support for Israel’s onslaught on Gaza, an imperialist hypocrisy that has tainted the West’s reputation, especially in the Global South. At the same time, China’s global rise and experimentation with socialist construction do not come without problems. Its economic diplomacy and trade strategies, which rely on its own brand of noninterference, sometimes intersect with domestic predatory elite interests in their counterparts, leading to cases of labor unrest and social tensions in Chinese investment sites. Given Indonesia’s strategic role in the Indo-Pacific, a closer examination on the intersection between this coming New Cold War and Indonesia’s domestic political-economic conditions is needed. I argue that the Indonesian state and ruling class, despite their public rhetoric of an independent foreign policy, have effectively and efficiently served the interests of multinational capital and, by extension, been implicated in Western imperial expansion.",

Everybody except the state of Israel, which has appreciated Harris’s vocal support for its settler colonial project.

They would be listening to what parents really want instead of stoking racial and social divisions to drain resources from public schools. In contrast, President Joe Biden has made historic investments in the education system in ways that truly value parent voices. Take Biden’s support for community schools, for example. These schools work with families, students, and their surrounding communities to not only improve student academic performance but also solve problems beyond the classroom and campus walls. Since 2020, the Biden Administration has increased federal funding for community schools five-fold. A recent report by In the Public Interest found that schools across the country are using the community school model, which is helping students by expanding the idea of what a school can be responsible for and how it can care for its students. For example, just outside of Tampa, Florida, Gibsonton Elementary School learned from families that many students felt unsafe walking to and from school. The school organized to have the county government install new streetlights and sidewalks near campus to increase student safety, immediately boosting attendance. Between 2017 and 2023, Gibsonton jumped from a “D”-rated school to nearly a “B” on the state’s annual academic report card. At Hoover Elementary School in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, school staff visit every family at home, connect families with mental health providers, and amplify parent voices. School administrators have also listened to suggestions from students, many of whom are newcomers from countries in Africa, to include more culturally diverse meals in the school’s food pantry, add more diverse books to the library, and incorporate more after-school programs.",

The former President also brought up Minnesota more than once, and got the facts wrong whenever he did. It’s true that Minnesota’s national profile has risen significantly in recent years. Our Democratic governor, Tim Walz, became Harris’s running mate in August, leading to a flood of interest in both Walz and the state he’s presided over since 2018. And before that, Minneapolis became the epicenter of a global Black Lives Matter movement in 2020 after George Floyd was murdered there that same year. Walz has clearly gotten under the skin of both Trump and his running mate, Republican Senator J.D. Vance. Maybe it’s Walz’s popularity, both as a governor and as a vice presidential candidate. On that front, he’s got Vance beat by quite a margin. A recent poll from USA Today and Suffolk University found that Walz ranks much higher than Vance with nearly every category of voter. Only 15 percent of Black voters polled found Vance appealing, for example, while more than half approved of Walz. When Harris brought up reproductive choice during the September 10 debate, Trump launched into a deranged sounding rant against Walz, claiming the Democratic vice presidential pick not only supports allowing abortions in the ninth month of pregnancy, but also the execution of newborn babies.",

In addition to an uptick in settler violence, there has been an increase in Israeli military activity in the region. Most recently, an Israeli soldier reportedly shot and killed Turkish American activist Aysenur Ezgi Eygi at a protest in the Palestinian town of Beita. Just over a week before the murder of Ezgi Eygi, Israel launched an operation that was quickly dubbed the largest West Bank offensive since the Second Intifada. This operation has taken place predominantly in Jenin, Tubas, and Tulkarm, all Palestinian cities located in Area A of the West Bank. According to the Oslo Accords, Area A falls under the military jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority, though Israeli raids in the region are common. The operation began on August 28 when undercover Israeli soldiers entered refugee camps in Jenin and Tulkarm, according to reporting by Middle East Eye. Israeli troops also reportedly entered the city of Tubas via helicopter, leading a military ground assault in the Far’a refugee camp, killing at least four people, including an UNRWA employee. Since the launch of this offensive, Israeli forces have killed nearly forty people, more than twenty of whom were from Jenin, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Government officials from Jenin have stated that the Israeli military has destroyed at least 70 percent of the city’s roads since the beginning of the operation, which Israel has named “Summer Camps.” The municipality also reported that twenty kilometers of water and sewage networks, communication, and electricity cables were all demolished by Israeli troops.",

Climate change, compounded by conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, threatens an oil disaster off the coast of Alaska, potentially devastating Indigenous communities and the nation’s richest fishing grounds. This danger arises from increasing oil traffic between Russia and China through Arctic waters bordering the United States. On August 29, Houthi rebels in Yemen attacked the Greek-flagged oil tanker Sounion in the Red Sea. A month later, it continues to burn and threaten a catastrophic oil spill, according to the United Nations. This incident is part of a broader trend of increased Houthi attacks on shipping since the Gaza war began. To avoid these dangers, many vessels are now rerouting around the southern tip of Africa. However, oil shipments have also been increasing through the Russian-controlled Northern Sea Route (NSR) in the Arctic, a pathway made navigable by melting sea ice due to climate change. In late August, the Azerbaijani-run Prisma, the largest crude oil tanker to use the NSR through the Arctic Ocean and the Chukchi and Bering Seas, transited from Russia to China carrying some one million barrels of oil on board and passing through the fifty-five-mile-wide Bering Strait between mainland Russia and the state of Alaska. Until then, all oil traffic on this route has been carried by Russian tankers as a way to help fund the war in Ukraine. China has become the largest buyer of cheap Russian crude oil, purchasing 52 percent of it since Western sanctions were imposed on Russia following its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.",

The July 23, 2024, hydrothermal explosion at Biscuit Basin resulted from water suddenly transitioning to steam in the shallow hydrothermal system beneath Black Diamond Pool and was not caused by volcanic activity. Seismicity, ground deformation, and gas and thermal emissions remain at their normal background levels, and there were no detectable precursors to this event. The explosion, which sent steam and debris to a height of hundreds of feet above the ground, destroyed a nearby boardwalk and ejected grapefruit-sized rocks tens to hundreds of feet from the source. Some blocks closest to the explosion site are about 3 feet (1 meter) wide and weigh hundreds of pounds. The explosion was largely directed to the northeast toward the Firehole River, and the largest blocks of debris fell in that direction.",

The NPS will prioritize the BCTP and place bison in the BCTP when bison migrate to the park boundary and there is space in the facility. The NPS will establish a population assurance threshold of 5,200 bison. This action was not in the original IBMP. When the population reaches this threshold, the NPS will begin to manage for a declining bison population by relying primarily on Tribal and state harvests. If harvests do not reduce numbers, the NPS will remove additional bison through the TFTP. When the population is below 5,200, the NPS will only place bison in the BCTP and use the TFTP to remove brucellosis-positive bison that are identified when animals are selected for the BCTP.

The Record of Decision , a culmination of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and National Environmental Policy Act process that began in 2022, will allow the NPS to manage bison based on new scientific information and circumstances that have changed since the previous EIS, completed in 2000.The NPS is implementing this decision because of new scientific information about bison and brucellosis transmission and changed circumstances that include fewer cattle near the park, brucellosis regulations, and Tribal hunting.",

The investigation into this incident, including the actions of the National Park Service (NPS) law enforcement rangers, is being led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and will be reviewed by the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Wyoming. Just after midnight on July 4, Yellowstone’s 911 dispatch center received a report that a woman had been held against her will by a man with a gun in a residence at Canyon Village. She also reported to law enforcement rangers that Fussner threatened to kill her and others, including plans to allegedly carry out a mass shooting(s) at July 4th events outside the park. Responding law enforcement rangers located his vehicle unoccupied in the Canyon area. The preliminary investigation indicated Fussner was likely armed and dangerous. With the individual at large, law enforcement rangers were strategically deployed to protect areas with park visitors and employees while searching for Fussner, and the park’s 911 dispatch center notified surrounding jurisdictions. By the early hours of July 4, over 20 NPS law enforcement rangers, including the park’s special response team, were working to protect people and locate Fussner.",

The road is a critical transportation link to Yellowstone’s major destinations and the millions of people who visit the park each year as well as local residents and surrounding communities. The project will significantly improve the exceptionally difficult and challenging roadway to improve safety and pedestrian access, alleviate rockfall hazards, and upgrade vehicle pullouts and parking areas, and add new pedestrian facilities to separate people from traffic.“Good transportation elements are key to experiencing the great outdoors at Yellowstone National Park,” said. “The grant for the National Park Service will make travel there more convenient for tourists, residents, workers and local businesses.”“The funding announced today is the latest in a multitude of collaborations undertaken as part of our partnership spanning decades with the National Park Service,” said. “This partnership is helping to make visits to Yellowstone and the 428 other national parks across the country safer, more enjoyable, and convenient for years to come.

In addition, he was placed on two years of unsupervised release and received a two-year ban from YNP for a closure violation. The court also ordered Pyshniuk to pay a $1,500 fine, $30 mandatory court processing fee and $20 special assessment.According to court documents, a YNP law enforcement officer was dispatched to the thermal area at Steamboat Geyser by an on-duty park employee who reported a person walking off the boardwalk at that location. The employee had taken a photo of the defendant who had clearly crossed over the fence and was walking up the hillside within 15-20 feet of Steamboat Geyser’s steam vent. When contacted, Pyshniuk told the officer he left the boardwalk to take photos. While speaking with Pyshniuk, the officer showed him the signs posted throughout the area stating it is illegal to leave the boardwalk and explained that walking in a thermal area is very dangerous due to possible weak ground layer, the geothermal features of mud pots, heated steam and water, and all other dangers associated with walking in a heated, unpredictable geothermal area.Magistrate Judge Stephanie A.

The FEIS presents a broad range of actions for managing bison inside the park. This plan allows the NPS to manage bison based on new scientific information and changed circumstances, explore ways to increase the transfer of bison to American Indian Tribes, and continue working closely with Tribal Nations and agency partners in management.The purpose of the EIS is to preserve an ecologically sustainable population of wild and migratory bison while continuing to work with partners to address issues related to brucellosis transmission, human safety, property damage, and to fulfill Tribal trust responsibilities.The FEIS solidifies the significant progress made over the past two decades by the Interagency Bison Management Plan (IBMP) partners and continues Yellowstone National Park’s commitment to the IBMP objectives which include: 1) maintain a wild, free-ranging bison population; 2) reduce the risk of brucellosis transmission from bison to cattle; 3) manage bison that leave Yellowstone National Park and enter the State of Montana; and 4) maintain Montana’s brucellosis-free status for domestic livestock.The FEIS also considers the bison management actions likely to occur on lands outside the park in Montana, maintains NPS’s continued commitment to working with the State of Montana, Tribes, and other federal partners to balance bison management efforts, while acknowledging the NPS does not have jurisdiction or control over actions such as hunting or tolerance for bison beyond the park boundary.The NPS’s FEIS considers alternatives to managing bison with varying population ranges and management activities.",

Frank\n\nApril 30, 2024\n\nContact: Morgan Warthin, (307) 344-2015\n\nMAMMOTH HOT SPRINGS, WY – Yellowstone National Park will implement new measures to help stop the spread of aquatic invasive species (AIS) into park waters. The restrictions include a 30-day mandatory dry time for sailboats and some types of motorized boats before entering park waters and the prohibition of watercraft previously fouled by mussels regardless of dry time.These restrictions will go into effect on Saturday, May 25, 2024, which is the first day of Yellowstone’s boating and fishing season. The season wraps up on Oct. 31 annually.Yellowstone faces an increased risk of invasion by highly invasive zebra and quagga mussels following recent detections (2022 Pactola Reservoir in South Dakota; and 2023 Snake River in Twin Falls, Idaho) in waterways within a day’s drive of the park. Mussels have caused irreversible ecological damage and extensive impacts to infrastructure and recreation in waterways throughout the Midwestern and Eastern United States, as well as in the lower Colorado River Basin. In both 2022 and 2023, Yellowstone’s AIS inspectors intercepted and denied launch to mussel-fouled watercraft, highlighting the urgency and severity of the threat.To protect park waters and respond to this threat, there will be a 30-day dry time requirement for sailboats and certain complex motorized boats (inboard, inboard/outboard and inboard jet) prior to launching. Large, complex, trailered watercraft pose the highest risk of transporting and introducing invasive mussels and other AIS because they are difficult to inspect and less likely to completely drain/dry or be fully decontaminated.",

Falgoust\n\nApril 24, 2024 BOZEMAN, MT - As part of ongoing grizzly bear and black bear research and management efforts and as required under the Endangered Species Act to monitor the population in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the U.S. Geological Survey, in conjunction with the National Park Service, is working to inform the public that scientific capture operations are once again about to begin within Yellowstone National Park.Biologists with the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team (IGBST) and Yellowstone National Park will begin field captures on May 1 and continue through Oct. 31. None of the trap sites in the park will be located near established hiking trails or backcountry campsites, and all trap sites will have posted warnings for the closure perimeter. Potential access points will also be posted with bright warning signs for the closure area. It is critical that the public heed these signs. Backcountry users who come upon any of these posted areas need to stay out of the area.Monitoring of grizzly bear distribution and other activities are vital to ongoing recovery of grizzly bears in the Yellowstone Ecosystem. In order to attract bears, biologists use natural food sources such as fresh road-killed deer and elk. Potential capture sites are baited with these natural foods and if indications are that grizzly bears are in the area, culvert traps or foot snares will be used to capture the bears. Once captured, bears are handled in accordance with strict safety and animal care protocols developed by the IGBST.Whenever bear capture activities are being conducted for scientific purposes, the area around the site will be posted with bright warning signs to inform the public of the activities occurring.",

U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephanie A. Hambrick imposed the sentence on March 14, in Mammoth, Wyoming. Mr. Brosnan pleaded guilty to foot travel in a thermal area. According to court documents, on or about Nov. 1, 2023, Brosnan uploaded pictures to his Instagram page of himself standing on a Yellowstone National Park thermal feature at Mammoth Hot Springs. There are signs posted in the area that warn visitors of the dangers of thermal features and state that visitors must remain on the designated boardwalks and trails. The United States Attorney’s Office asked the court to sentence Brosnan to 2 years’ probation and the maximum fine of $5,000. The National Park Service (NPS) reminds Yellowstone visitors that the ground in thermal areas is fragile and thin, and scalding water is just below the surface. Therefore, trespassing on thermal features is dangerous and can harm delicate natural resources within the park. Additionally, the park was established primarily to protect these hydrothermal areas. NPS encourages visitors to exercise extreme caution around thermal features by staying on boardwalks and trails. NPS also urges people to protect themselves and the fragile environment by taking the Yellowstone Pledge: act responsibly and safely and set a good example for others.",

The proposals include a 30-day mandatory dry time for some types of motorized boats and sailboats before entering park waters and the prohibition of watercraft previously fouled by mussels regardless of dry time.Yellowstone faces an increased risk of invasion by highly invasive zebra and quagga mussels following recent detections (2022 Pactola Reservoir, South Dakota, and 2023 Snake River, Twin Falls, Idaho) in waterways within a day’s drive of the park. Mussels have caused irreversible ecological damage and extensive impacts to infrastructure and recreation in waterways throughout the Midwestern and Eastern United States, as well as in the lower Colorado River Basin. In both 2022 and 2023, Yellowstone’s AIS inspectors intercepted and denied launch to mussel-fouled watercraft, highlighting the urgency and severity of the threat.To protect park waters and respond to this threat, Yellowstone proposes a 30-day dry time requirement for complex, motorized boats (inboard, inboard/outboard, and inboard jet) and sailboats prior to launching.

While the brain is viewed as the seat of the mind, the stomach is often relegated to the status of a mere “workaday organ,” Richardson adds, with a purely physical function and no part in defining our identity. However, expressions like “strong stomach” and “trust your gut” hint that this was not always the case. As recently as the mid-20th century, the human stomach was believed to exert a powerful and direct influence on mood and personality: You were what you ate, literally. This is one of the major themes of Richardson’s book Rumbles: A Curious History of the Gut, which comes out in October. “Are we our brains?” Richardson asks. “Or is it a little bit more complicated than that?”\n\nA lecturer in history at the University of Strathclyde, Scotland, Richardson describes herself as “a historian of the body and the self,” researching how our understanding of who we are changes across time. In Rumbles, she traces the gut’s history in Western culture, and the various ways the organ has been conceptualized: from the medieval scholars who sought to balance the four humors of the body (and thus the mood) through eating, to the 19th-century doctors who thought of constipation as the root cause of illness, to modern wellness culture centered around a garden of gut flora. Elsa Richardson asks us to consider how culture and history inform the way we see our stomach.",

The British then arrested him and sent him into exile in 1896. Prempeh I spent the first four years of exile in the British colony of Freetown in Sierra Leone, in a house at 9 Howe Street. Besides himself, the monarch was detained with several members of his court.\n\nIn 1900, the “War of the Golden Stool” broke out as the British extended their rule over the Ashanti kingdom. Fearing the proximity to his former kingdom, the British then sent Prempeh I to the Seychelles, where he remained until his return from exile in 1924.\n\nAlthough the house where Prempeh I stayed is long gone, in 2005 the Sierra Leone Monuments and Relics Commission placed a plaque on the spot, commemorating the Asantehene’s stay. There ceremony was attended by the Ghananian High Commissioner to Sierra Leone.",

On it is a sign that reads: “From Cluny Hill witches were rolled in stout barrels through which spikes were driven. Where the barrels stopped they were burned with their mangled contents. This stone marks the site of one such burning.” Though there is no date mentioned, there are theories that it is associated with a story involving King Duncan who was said to have been bewitched in the 11th century. It also can be attributed to what is often referred to as Scotland’s 16th-century witch craze. Under the Scottish Witchcraft Act 1563, the practice of witchcraft and consulting with witches were both considered capital offenses\n\nDuring the period that followed, the country saw an estimated 4,000 people put to death, accused of practicing the dark arts. These governmental sanctioned acts of cruelty eventually ceased during the Reformation. The law was not overturned until the middle of the 18th century. One may also notice that the large stone is broken in several places and held together with a giant metal clasp. It has been suggested that boulder was initially broken up to be used towards the construction of several homes. But when the occupants became ill, the stones were returned to the original location, possibly out of suspicion that the stone held a curse.",

It’s known affectionately as “The Old Man of Shore Road.” This isn’t your average roadside attraction—it’s a natural wonder that plays a delightful game of hide and seek with those who pass by.\n\nJust like the famous Old Man of the Mountain that once watched over New Hampshire’s Franconia Notch, the Old Man of Shore Road offers a chance to see nature’s artistry in the form of a rock formation that, at just the right angle, casts a profile of an old man’s face.\n\nDepending on the direction you’re driving and how the light dances with the landscape, you might see him, or you might miss him altogether. But that’s the beauty of it—the Old Man doesn’t just give away his secrets to anyone. It takes a keen eye and a bit of luck.\n\nFor those who are fortunate enough to catch a glimpse, the Old Man seems to be gazing out towards the road, as if keeping watch over the travelers. Some say he’s the guardian of the coast, others a silent observer of the passing seasons.\n\nSo if you find yourself meandering along the scenic routes of coastal Maine, keep an eye out for the Old Man of Shore Road. Slow down a bit as you approach Chimney Rock Road. Who knows, maybe you’ll meet the steady gaze of this silent sentinel, a fleeting connection between you and the long-standing history of this picturesque state.",

Irrigation projects, under the rubric of “reclamation,” were all the rage during the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the Western United States. A degree of federal support was furnished by the Carey Act (or Federal Desert Lands Act) of 1894, which provided a way to deed Federal lands to farmers if some percentage was irrigated. The program was to be overseen by the states and the details varied, but overall private companies were to build infrastructure and sell rights to land and water, with the Federal government finally transferring the land when sufficient irrigation had been established. Tumalo (pronounced “TUM-uh-loh”) Creek, a tributary of the Deschutes River west of Bend, Oregon, was an early focus of irrigation ventures. In a harbinger of things to come, around the turn of the last century, Three Sisters Irrigation Co. proposed diverting for irrigation far more water than actually flows in the creek. Promoter and scam artist William A. Laidlaw showed up in 1902 and incorporated all the previous ventures into the Columbia Southern Irrigation Co. The company platted the town of Laidlaw and began selling irrigation lands and theoretical water rights—despite how little infrastructure had been built. Some 18,000 acres had been sold by 1907, but only about a thousand were ever actually irrigated. The company made off with some $475,000 (equivalent to about $13 million in 2015), of which Laidlaw personally kept some $116,000. The infuriated, and scammed, settlers hanged Laidlaw in effigy and later renamed the townsite “Tumalo” (as it remains today), but the money was never recovered.",

The Four met at the Glasgow School of Art when they studied there at the end of the 19th century. The men were architecture students who incorporated Art Nouveau into their designs, leading to a distinctive Glasgow Style. The Mackintoshes lived in a house at 6 Florentine Terrace, in the Hillhead neighborhood, close to the current location of the Hunterian Art Gallery.\n\nIronically, many buildings including the Mackintosh home were demolished to make way for new buildings of the University of Glasgow, which runs the Hunterian. When 6 Florentine Terrace was demolished in the 1960s, the legacy of the late Mackintoshes was already well-established, so it was decided that the furnishings of most of the house would be preserved and documented as best as possible.\n\nThanks to this foresight, the Hunterian was able to recreate several of the rooms of their house. The restored dining room, bedroom, hall, and other spaces feature the original furniture and decorations of the Mackintoshes along with some reproductions for lost items.

Perched on a hill in the heart of downtown is an important site in the process that made this little mountain village the tourism juggernaut that it is today.\n\nIn 1903, Denver Post editor Albert Birch began spending his summers in Estes Park. He grew to love the natural beauty and easy access to Denver and Fort Collins so much that he hired stonemason Carl Piltz to build a small bungalow on a rocky outcropping in the middle of the town, which Birch named “Jacob’s Ladder” for the steep climb he had to make to access the house. From this point, Birch could enjoy majestic views of the Front Range and its centerpiece Longs Peak.\n\nHowever, a few years later in 1907, the bungalow caught fire. The precise cause of the fire is unknown, but the house was a total loss. All that remained were the stone walls and fireplace that exist today. Their survival is a testament to the skill of Carl Piltz, who went on to become a highly regarded architect in the area.\n\nAfter the loss of Jacob’s Ladder, Birch built a small cabin at the bottom of the hill for use as a summer home up until the 1980s, which still stands today. Twenty years later, the Town of Estes Park assumed ownership of the site, now known as the Knoll-Willows Open Space.

This is Guluf Airline Restaurant, a Somali “airline” whose only plane will never fly again, and you’re welcome to come inside for a meal or a cup of tea. The Ilyushin Il-18V airplane was produced between 1959 and 1965, and was widely exported to USSR-friendly countries. This particular Il-18V was used for 29 years from 1962 to 1991 by TAROM, Romania’s government-owned airline, outliving Romania’s communist regime by a year and a half. It was retired and kept in storage for seven years, until it returned to the sky in May 1998 for a new life of crime. Infamous Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout, AKA the Merchant of Death, purchased it and relocated it to Africa, where he almost surely used it to transport weapons to western African nations in violation of international arms embargoes. From there, the plane eventually changed hands a couple more times, and was still flying as late as 2007. After 45 years, it was finally retired for good after an incident where the landing gear initially refused to extend on descent.

However, if you venture through side streets in the historic district, you might be faced with an unusal sight: two wooden statues, several meters high, appearing to be engaged in strange and somewhat obscene activities. The man is holding bellows, pointing them towards the woman’s behind, as she kneels and lifts her skirt . As a nearby panel explains, the statues represent two carnival characters: the Vieille Bouchée (“old stuck-up”), a prudish old woman who keeps farting in church, and the Soufflacul (literally “ass-blower”), a mischievous jester who is the star of a long-running show. Since the Middle Ages, during the town festival, men have dressed up in special attire to play the role of the Soufflacul: loose white shirts and pants, donning white makeup (or, more frequently, flour), covering their heads with hats and wigs. But being a Soufflacul isn’t just about the costume. First, they have to perform a complex choreography, forming a procession and blowing on the butts of those who stand before them while singing folk songs. The real climax, though, comes when they break the formation, burst through doors asking for alcohol, and use their bellows to blow the demons away under women’s skirts. Finally, the procession stops in front of the town hall, where the most illustrious party-goers are inducted as members of the Order of the Valiant Sardine by the mayor.",

Since the annual event takes place in October in Bristol, England, raincoats and umbrellas are also typical fashion statements—perhaps disappointing anyone hoping for some medieval cosplay to acknowledge the deep history of the walk, which may be more than 800 years old. But then, the St. Mary Redcliffe Pipe Walk, honoring an agreement that dates back to the days of King Richard the Lionheart, has always been a no-nonsense, utilitarian affair. The mile-plus walk through Bristol’s south side follows the route of a medieval conduit that began piping water from a well to the parish in the late 12th century. It’s uncertain exactly when the first walk to inspect the pipe occurred, but it has become both a beloved annual ramble and a charmingly eccentric way to reconnect with history—even though the pipe itself has long been disconnected. The parish pipe story began in 1190, when Robert de Berkeley, a knight of the realm and local benefactor, granted St. Mary Redcliffe—then a young and struggling parish—perpetual rights to the waters of the Ruge Well, a distant spring south of the church. The annual pipe walk (shown in red) moves north from the ancient well, through neighborhoods and Victoria Park, before veering west to follow a 19th-century diversion.

Grandma Agi, as Salamon calls his paternal grandmother, transformed the dish into a “DIY party,” where everyone could assemble their own perfect bites from a spread of homemade jams, chocolate sauce, whipped cream, nuts, and sugars scented with cinnamon or rose. And in lieu of bone china, Grandma Agi opted for melamine plates adorned with Walt Disney or McDonald’s characters. “It was so much fun. You could just go to town and make it really messy and roll it up,” Salamon says.

With maze-like mangrove tunnels teeming with marine life, small islands found along the coasts, and places to float alongside manatees, the southeasternmost state is paradise for travelers looking to immerse themselves in nature with paddle in hand. Step 1: Choose Your Craft\n\nThere are multiple ways to get out on the water without diving in, so it’s important to choose the right kind of vessel, both for your skill and comfort level and for the conditions. Kayaks and canoes tend to be better for cooler seasons and windy conditions. They have space for supplies, are better for long distances, are more stable, and can sometimes accommodate two people, making them ideal for paddling with a friend. On the other hand, stand-up paddle boards let riders see the sights from a higher vantage point. They are great for warm weather, offer a good workout, and allow tremendous freedom of movement. If you don’t have your own SUP or kayak, there are plenty of places to rent one and to see what suits you best. Step 2: Map the Route\n\nIt’s easy to get swept up in the excitement of exploring a destination teeming with wildlife, fish, and unique landscapes. However, it’s important to consider changing tides and the fact that it can be easy to get turned around. Research where you’ll be going ahead of time and map how to get back to your starting point.

From Cape Canaveral on the Atlantic to the westernmost Keys, incredible flora and fauna are waiting to be discovered, including enormous loggerhead sea turtles, diminutive Key deer, rare Florida panthers, elusive ghost orchids, and exotic Roseate Spoonbills. Use these tips to make the most of your Florida wildlife adventure:\n\nPlan for the seasons. Winter is an ideal time to view animals, when heat and humidity are lower and millions of migratory birds are overwintering. During this dry season, which begins in November and extends to May, it’s easier to see animals gathering at watering holes. The wet season, from June to October, can present challenges like afternoon thunderstorms, heat and humidity, and difficulty viewing animals that are moving to drier grounds. Stay alert. Alligators and snakes abound in Florida and play vital roles in the ecosystem. They are rarely aggressive towards people unless provoked, so stay on trails, read park signs, and make sure everyone in your crew is paying close attention to their surroundings. Don’t rely on your phone for everything. If you end up with no cell coverage or your battery runs out, you may not be able to access trail apps or other tools. Study park guides before heading out or take a printed trail map. Binoculars and SLR cameras with telephoto lenses are still the most effective ways to view and photograph wildlife. Keep a journal. You may not be a serious birder right now, or you may not care whether that was an armadillo or opossum that just crossed your path, but jot down a few notes anyway so you can look back later and recall which species you witnessed and where.",

Humans are also unusual in our depth of engagement with our fellow living creatures—the plants, animals, and organisms upon whom our lives completely depend.

However, a past landlord must have blindfolded themselves before setting out to renovate the bathroom and kitchen, both of which have uneven shelves, sloppy paint jobs, hard-to-reach light switches, and sad vinyl flooring. To distract myself from all these faults, I’ve had to get creative with decor.

Across human history, no single animal has had a deeper impact on human societies than the horse. But when and how people domesticated horses has been an ongoing scientific mystery. Half a million years ago or more, early human ancestors hunted horses with wooden spears, the very first weapons, and used their bones for early tools. During the late Paleolithic era, as far back as 30,000 years ago or more, ancient artists chose wild horses as their muse: Horses are the most commonly depicted animal in Eurasian cave art. Following their first domestication, horses became the foundation of herding life in the grasslands of Inner Asia, and key leaps forward in technology such as the chariot, saddle, and stirrup helped make horses the primary means of locomotion for travel, communication, agriculture, and warfare across much of the ancient world. With the aid of ocean voyages, these animals eventually reached the shores of every major landmass—even Antarctica, briefly. As they spread, horses reshaped ecology, social structures, and economies at a never-before-seen scale. Ultimately, only industrial mechanization supplanted their near-universal role in society. Horses have long been revered in the steppes of Inner Asia, as seen by the horse skulls and prayer flags at this monument to racehorses in central Mongolia. William Taylor\n\nBecause of their tremendous impact in shaping our collective human story, figuring out when, why, and how horses became domesticated is a key step toward understanding the world we live in now.

Every year in mid-September, lost and confused baby puffins wander the streets at night. “They’re everywhere,” says Audrey Padgett, manager of the Sea Life Trust Beluga Whale Sanctuary in Heimaey. “It feels like puffins are raining from the sky.”\n\nHeimaey is home to the world’s largest puffin colony. The neon-billed birds have dug more than a million burrows along the island’s steep, grassy cliffs, which rise above the town of 4,500 people. Once a source of food for islanders, they have more recently become some of Iceland’s most famous residents, attracting tourists and serving as unofficial mascots for the whole country. (Stuffed toy versions of the birds have become so ubiquitous as souvenirs that stores geared toward tourists are colloquially known as “puffin shops.”)\n\nWhile puffins spend most of the year at sea, bobbing on the water and diving for fish, they return to the same burrow every summer to breed. From mid-April to early May, puffin pairs—who mate for life—can be spotted coming ashore to get comfy, lay eggs, and raise their chicks, who are known as pufflings. A group of puffins on Heimaey.",

        "text": "Indigenous Brazilians have fermented alcoholic beverages from the cassava root for thousands of years. These beer-like beverages go by names like cauim, caxiri, and tarubá. Fermentation is an important step in cassava processing—the raw root has chemicals that can turn into cyanide in the human body. Native peoples found that a bit of human saliva and some naturally occurring yeast could eliminate these toxins and improve the nutritious value of the tuber. When the technology of distillation arrived to the Munim River region (now in Maranhão), locals who already drank lightly alcoholic cassava beverages began to distill them. Tiquira was born. The name tiquira is likely derived from the Tupi word tykyre meaning “to drip.” But it is a curiosity that the spirit has flourished in only one Brazilian state, Maranhão. Margot Stinglwagner, founder of Guaaja Tiquira, the first modern brand to produce the spirit starting in 2016, says “It’s a spirit that is also unknown in Brazil. A few people have heard about tiquira—but usually only people who have gone to Maranhão once.” Accordingly, the state moved to declare the spirit as a piece of Cultural and Intangible Heritage in September 2023. Part of the reason that tiquira has remained so isolated is that cachaça, Brazil’s rum, is far easier to produce. Because the rum comes from sugarcane, the sugar for fermentation is already there. “With cassava, you don’t have sugar,” Stinglwagner explains. “You must first transform the carbohydrates into sugar and then you can ferment and distill it.” To achieve this end, Guaaja Tiquira uses food enzymes instead of the traditional human saliva.",

        "text": "The origins of Germany’s Maultaschen are deliciously devious. Legend has it that, in the late Middle Ages, a lay brother named Jakob invented the stuffed pasta dumplings at the Maulbronn Monastery, a UNESCO World Heritage site founded in 1147 by Cistercian monks in southwest Germany. One direct translation of Maultaschen is “mouth pockets,” though “Maul” could just as easily refer to Maulbronn. Maultaschen are usually square dumplings (though sometimes they’re rolled) and can be fried in a pan or served in broth. Commonly described as Germany’s version of Italian ravioli, they allegedly emerged as a way to use up an unexpected bounty of meat that Brother Jakob stumbled upon in the forest outside the monastery walls. The twist? Although they abhorred waste, these monks weren’t allowed to eat the meat of four-legged animals, especially during the Catholic fasting period of Lent in the spring. So Brother Jakob minced the meat with herbs and onions and wrapped everything inside pasta dough, hiding the forbidden flesh from the eyes of his fellow monks—and even from the eyes of God. In Swabia, the region encompassing much of Baden-Württemberg and part of Bavaria where Maultaschen originated, one of the colloquial names for the food references this deception directly: Herrgottsbescheißerle means “little God-cheaters.”\n\nEveryone in Swabia has their version of the legend with more or less embellishment. Ludwig Nestler holds a master’s degree in heritage conservation and works for the State Palaces and Gardens of Baden-Württemberg, a government organization that oversees monuments like Maulbronn Monastery. His version of the tale includes a sack of stolen meat dropped in the woods by a fleeing thief, which inspires Brother Jakob’s trickery in the kitchen.",

        "text": "In 1914, absinthe was outlawed in France. In the small mountain town of Pontarlier, the world capital of absinthe, the news devastated the livelihoods of thousands of local workers. Nearly all the town’s distilleries closed their doors or relocated. But one producer, Distillerie Guy, remained open, all thanks to adaptation and innovation. Its bestselling drink, Pont (formally known as Pontarlier-Anis), was created as a result of the absinthe ban and remains a beloved classic at the distillery to this day. Pont was the invention of George and Armaund Guy, whose family distillery had been making absinthe since 1890. Following the nationwide ban, the distillers continued to use their absinthe recipe, with one key change: excluding the supposedly “madness-inducing” ingredient, thujone, and replacing it with green anise. When poured, Pont is clear as the local mountain water it contains, turning to a cloud of white when diluted. It has a frosty freshness, not unlike the sensation of breathing after chewing on a mint, while whipping the tongue with a smooth licorice sweetness. The licorice taste comes from the distillation of green anise, differentiating it from the star anise used in other anise spirits such as ouzo or pastis. Compared to those spirits, “Pont is lighter, purer, more subtle,” says Sébastien Siredey, who works at Distillerie Guy. “It is distilled from natural ingredients. It is more haut-de-gamme than pastis.”\n\nPont also appears in a powerful local mixed drink known as the “Sapont.” The drink is a portmanteau that combines Pont with Sapin, the French word for “fir tree” that’s also the name of another liquor produced by Distillerie Guy.",

Oyo, the India-based hotel giant, has agreed to acquire the Motel 6 and Studio 6 hotel brands from Blackstone for $525 million in an all-cash deal, Blackstone said in a press release. The big picture: This acquisition marks a second attempt by Oyo to expand in the U.S. market ahead of the Softbank-backed startup’s ongoing effort to go public in India. The companies couldn’t be reached by publication time for comment. The Wall Street Journal was first to report the news Friday. By the numbers:\n\nMotel 6 has about 1,500 locations across the U.S. and Canada and is now an asset-light brand. Oyo currently operates 320 hotels across 35 U.S. states. Motel 6’s franchise network generates $1.7 billion in annual gross room revenues. Oyo was valued last month at $2.4 billion in a round of fundraising.

The inn, designed to reflect local architecture, involved the island's 2,500 residents in its creation and is owned by Shorefast, a charity Cobb established. Cobb advocates for a tourism industry that prioritizes the social and cultural aspects of destinations, urging other hotel chains to learn from this community-centric approach.

The high-end inn has three Michelin keys and was designed to look like a local home on stilts with wood in keeping with the island’s traditional style.

Business is way up, yet housekeeping services have been scaled back—sometimes you won't receive much hospitality at all. Amenities are being cut. Guests aren't getting fresh towels, trash isn't being emptied, breakfasts are being cut back, and front desk staffing is often inadequate, multiplying normal wait times. At many hotels, customers are still being charged resort fees despite the cutbacks. Don't blame the hotel staff—there aren't enough of them anymore. According to Unite Here, a group representing about 40,000 hospitality employees, staffing at American hotels went down 13% from 2019 to 2022 even though room rates have ballooned by 20%. Many hotels have maintained their skimpy staffing levels from Covid-19 despite a giant upswing in travel. Despite being full, U.S. hotels employ some 200,000 fewer workers now than before the pandemic, and the workers who remain are seeing their hours cut, minimizing opportunities for overtime. So employees are being forced to do the jobs of several people—without an increase in pay. Amid all those challenges, hotel workers face the same price inflation and rent increases that have slammed all of us. What's more, about 9 in 10 housekeeping workers in the U.S. are women, racial minorities, or immigrant workers, according to federal statistics. Those groups already have to deal with outsize economic and social pressures. \"During Covid, everyone suffered, but now the hotel industry is making record profits while workers and guests are left behind,\" Gwen Mills, international president of Unite Here, has said.",

The U.S. State Department has announced that passport renewal via its website is officially open as of Wednesday, September 18, 2024. Until now, when a U.S. passport expired or was close to expiration, American passport holders were forced to go through the laborious process of arranging to have new passport photos taken, printing government forms, and assembling an application packet (including a check, the old passport, and other identification documents) to mail to a distant government address. Then they waited. The ordeal was like applying for a new passport all over again. All of that is in the past—including a good chunk of the waiting. In late 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order calling for the creation of a digital renewal system that would allow Americans so simply request a passport renewal from the comfort of their own homes. \"Every interaction between the Federal Government and the public, whether it involves renewing a passport or calling for a status update on a farm loan application, should be seen as an opportunity for the Government to save an individual’s time (and thus reduce 'time taxes') and to deliver the level of service that the public expects and deserves,\" the order stated. By late 2022, the first beta version of the passport renewal system opened for testing to a small group of guinea pigs, and there was strict daily limit for applications. Following a few periods when the nascent system was temporarily withdrawn for tinkering, the finished passport renewal portal has finally been declared ready for everyone, without daily caps on participants, and for good.",

And even that was a long time coming. JetBlue, which began flying in 2000, announced its intention to add free Wi-Fi for customers back in 2013, but it wasn't until early 2017 that the airline was able to extend the amenity on every jet at every seat. Delta Air Lines is currently in the process of rolling out free Wi-Fi to all of its flights, another multiyear process that the company says will finally be finished by the end of 2025. The rarity of free Wi-Fi on flights operated by U.S. carriers isn't because the tech is impossible to figure out. It's because the major airlines decided they'd rather milk their customers for the privilege of basic connectivity. Most airlines have insisted customers pay extra for the service, either in the form of per-flight add-on fees or elevated status achieved through more expensive ticket purchases. On United Airlines in 2024, for example, Wi-Fi costs $8 or 800 miles per flight for the carrier's frequent flyer members and $10 for everyone else. But in September 2024, as business expense accounts dry up, United finally announced its intention to emulate JetBlue's free-to-all generosity. United announced it will add Wi-Fi to all its planes, and, moreover, the company will give the perk free to every passenger regardless of ticket class. JetBlue took nearly 4 years to implement a similar promise. So when will passengers actually be able to use free Wi-Fi on United Airlines?",

(Note that the itinerary that follows is likewise good for spring, summer, and early fall; options on Cape Cod grow limited in winter.)\n\nDon’t try to drive all the way to Provincetown and think you can get a full day of activities in before returning to Boston by nightfall. Summer traffic is notoriously slow and parking in P-town is scarce. You won't need a car once you get there, either—everything is within easy walking or biking distance.\n\nFor my August day trip, my husband and I caught the first Fast Ferry of the day, which pulls out of Boston’s Seaport District at 8:30am and arrives at Provincetown’s MacMillan Pier a mere 90 minutes later. Book the last returning ferry, departing Provincetown at 7:30pm, and that gives you more than 9 hours to fill on the Outer Cape.",

Makes sense—where there are trees, after all, there are usually leaves. Of course, some trees have more potential for color than others, and some parks have more miles of trails to get you closer to more reds, oranges, and yellows. To help narrow things down, the digital navigation platform onX, which provides maps and other resources for outdoor recreationists via a suite of mobile apps, has identified nine national parks that have the best fall foliage, according to the company’s research. The company came up with the list by using the onX Hunt app’s “Deciduous Tree Layer” filter. With it, analysts found the national parks with the highest density of trees known for colorful leaves—oak, maple, hickory, birch, and so on. The ranking also takes into account the amount of trail mileage in each park, ensuring that visitors can actually get to see a large proportion of the leaves on display. And to help with trip timing, onX’s leaf-peeping pros relied on satellite imagery to determine when each park reached peak fall color in 2023 so that you can take that factor into account when planning your autumn travels for 2024. (Another key variable affecting fall foliage is the weather—click here to see what forecasters are predicting for this year). Based on that criteria, onX ended up with a top nine that includes an intriguing mix of autumn standbys and underrated spots deserving more attention. Below, you'll find the company's ranking of the best national parks by fall foliage potential, along with each park's total of trail miles, the types of trees you'll see there, and dates when each location reached peak autumn colors last year.",

When it comes to memories, after all, it's wise to heed the words of whichever Left Bank philosophe said, \"You've got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em.\" Apparently, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo didn't get le memo. Hidalgo wants the Eiffel Tower to continue sporting the five big colorful Olympic rings that were affixed to the landmark for the Summer Games, which ended August 11, and Paralympic Games, which ended September 8. The mayor's plans would keep the rings on the tower until \"at least 2028,\" when the next Olympic Games will be held in Los Angeles, reports CBS News. Until 2028 at least?

So, yes, they [the rings] will stay on the Eiffel Tower.”\n\nOpposition to Making Olympic Rings on Eiffel Tower Permanent\n\nBut other politicians, landmark preservation groups, ordinary Parisians, and the descendants of the tower's designer are less than thrilled with the idea. The family of Gustave Eiffel, the engineer credited with devising the tower that bears his name, strongly opposes leaving the rings up indefinitely. In a statement released through the family's foundation, AGDE, Eiffel's descendants argue that the Olympic symbol shouldn't remain because it is \"colourful, large in size, placed on the main avenue of approach to the tower [and] creates a strong imbalance\" in the landmark's shape, \"substantially modifying the very pure forms of the monument.\"",

The Douro River starts in north-central Spain and zigzags some 500 miles into Portugal before eventually reaching the Atlantic Ocean. Along the way, the curving, rock-lined river cuts through a landscape characterized, above all, by its connection to generations of winemaking. A cruise along the Douro provides not only a chance to encounter medieval fortress towns and sample the region's renowned port and other wines, but also to appreciate, as you travel along the waterway, the sheer beauty of the surrounding hillsides covered in a patchwork quilt of vineyards along with cork oak, olive, and fig trees. I recently spent a week aboard Uniworld’s SS São Gabriel, a luxury ship launched in 2021 for the exclusive purpose of cruising Portugal’s Douro River Valley. Journeying 250 miles round trip from Porto, the ship accommodates up to 100 passengers and is just 262 feet long. To fit into the five lock chambers along the route, all ships on the river are about half the length of boats plying other European waterways like the Rhine and Danube. It's easy to make friends among the small contingent of passengers as you take day tours or mingle in the ship's lounge at happy hour and at mealtime in the open-seating restaurant. Among the most high-end river cruise lines operating in Europe, Uniworld offers all-inclusive fares covering meals, drinks, gratuities, and daily excursions.

In a wedge of the country stretching from the interior Northeast and Great Lakes region down through the Mississippi River Valley, conditions this year are ideal, the forecast predicts, for the sort of bright red, orange, and yellow leaves that make for memorable autumn road trips and excursions to apple orchards and pumpkin patches. This summer's \"above-historical average rainfall\" in New England, meanwhile, will result in \"typical to dull\" fall foliage in much of that region, per AccuWeather. That's right: You just saw \"dull fall foliage\" and \"New England\" in the same sentence. Hope we didn't make you spit out your PSL. \"We expect more yellows and browns ... along the East coast,\" writes AccuWeather long-range expert Paul Pastelok in the forecast. \"We've had a lot of precipitation already and more rain is expected to persist going through early fall. ... We're looking at warmer and more humid conditions later in September for the East, so expect some duller colors.\" While too much rain could mute the autumn show in the East, too little precipitation and high temperatures could cause lackluster leaves in the Northwest and Rocky Mountains, Pastelok warns. Where Fall Foliage Will Be Best in 2024\n\nWhat trees need to put on their best fall displays are sunny days and cool nights in the early part of the season. That's why AccuWeather's experts think the best spots for leaf peeping in 2024 will be around the Great Lakes, inland regions of the Northeast, and the middle of the country.",

They're attempting to re-create in live action the Temple Run video game, which was first released in 2011 and centers on an explorer dashing through stone ruins while pursued by demonic monkeys. Because Temple Run's animation resembles the 900-year-old Angkor ruins, social media users can create easily recognizable replicas of the game by speeding along the UNESCO World Heritage Site's stone pathways, leaping to collect imaginary coins, and rushing headlong into stone chambers and narrow corridors. Many of the clips use sounds from the game and some feature overlays of Temple Run graphics. What wit. There are at least two big problems with the trend, however. First, Angkor's more than 100 Hindu-Buddhist temples make up what UNESCO describes as \"one of the most important archaeological sites in South-East Asia.\" Spreading across 400 acres and dating back almost a millennium, the temples of the complex contain priceless carvings and sculptures that could be damaged by TikTokkers crashing around the place just because nobody gave them enough attention when they were children. “It’s nonsense,” conservationist Hans Leisen, who has worked for decades to preserve Angkor Wat's sculptures, told Bloomberg. “If you’re running through the temple, you will not see the beauty of the carvings. And if you fall or stumble, you’ll touch a wall to stabilize yourself and endanger the fragile carvings.”\n\nWhat's more—and this is the second big problem with the Temple Run videos—the trend is profoundly disrespectful to the site's cultural and religious significance.",

You get up in the morning, go out on a game drive for most of the day, come back, have a shower, a sundowner, dinner, chit chat, and go to bed,” says Alan Feldstein at Infinite Safari Adventures. “How much time did you really spend at that expensive lodge?

The European Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson, confirmed in a speech that the EU intends to implement the new system on November 10, 2024. \"After intense dialogues with Member States, with you, with the different stakeholders, I have decided that the Entry/Exit System will enter into operations on the 10th of November,\" said Johansson, according to Schengen.News. \"Different steps are legally required before the Commission could take the formal decision, but I am proud to reveal today that the 10th of November is the target day.\" What is Europe's new Entry/Exit System (EES)? Europe's new Entry/Exit System is intended to replace passport stamping by electronically registering the arrival and departure of international visitors to and from most EU member states. Upon arrival in Europe, passport control officers will scan your face, record a digital scan of your fingerprints—these scans will be mandatory—and not stamp your passport. When visitors leave Europe, they'll scan face and fingers once again to register their departure. Visitors will be able to speed their first arrival at a European border by pre-registering using a mobile app (not yet available) or the automated kiosks (which the EU calls \"self-service systems\") installed at major border entry ports such as airports.",

Inventory is limited and demand is high, especially during the peak travel months of May to September.\n\nBut if you’re planning to vacation in what is known as \"the rail belt”—a wide swath of Southcentral Alaska that includes Denali National Park, Seward, Fairbanks, and Anchorage—you can take the train instead, thanks to passenger service available from the Alaska Railroad.\n\nThere are some serious perks to seeing the state by rail, starting with the relief that drivers will feel from not having to keep their eyes glued to a narrow, winding road. On the train, all you have to do is sit back and enjoy the scenery, some of which you can’t even access by car.\n\nThe 10-day itinerary we’ve put together below involves some fairly long-distance train rides on the Alaska Railroad. You won't have to deal with any quick, commuter-style transfers, but the cost of train tickets does add up pretty quickly. That makes this kind of trip best for singles, couples, and small families with some money to burn—if you’re looking to save money, you’ll probably find that accessing the stops along the route we’ve mapped will be cheaper if you rent a car or bring your own vehicle.\n\nIf you don't have a full 10 days to spend in Alaska, you can easily split this itinerary into two parts: The first runs from day 1 through day 4 and includes Anchorage and Seward; the second part is day 5 through day 10 and includes Anchorage, Talkeetna, Denali National Park, and Fairbanks.\n\nTo book train tickets, find travel packages, and get additional information, go to AlaskaRailroad.com.",

Our guide book author, a 15-year resident, knows the best places to apply your budget, no matter how high or low it is. No one likes to spend unwisely, not even on vacation. And it’s equally disappointing whether you spend too much money on overpriced experiences or you spend too little and get a subpar hotel room, a bad meal (yep, they exist in Italy), or a too-cheap souvenir. So let my experience help you. I have lived in Italy for more than 15 years and I’ve traveled the country extensively. I’m also the author or co-author of several of Frommer’s popular guide books to Italy, so I understand where visitors can best spend their money on their Italian vacation. Here are my tips on where it's fine to save some euros and when you should splurge a little—plus a few personal recommendations of my own—that you can use to choose your expenses wisely on a trip in Italy. Where to save money on experiences in Italy\n\nThese tips will help you get a better feel for Italian culture and daily life and still not feel like you’ve missed out on anything. Don’t rent a car. Ride. Skip rental cars and parking fees, and instead rely on Italy’s comprehensive network of trains, buses, and even passenger ferries.

PHEIC declarations are often used to formally open global government channels to coordinate efforts to combat the spread of a disease. Currently, only three diseases merit the dire PHEIC-level warning: Covid-19, cholera, and now mpox. Earlier in the week, Africa's coordinating health body, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, declared a similar emergency on that continent. According to the group, more than 15,000 cases of mpox have been declared in Africa in 2024, representing a 160% rise over 2023. The group reports 461 deaths so far across 18 countries and an alarming rate of expansion. There are two versions of mpox, Clade I and Clade II. In 2022, the milder version, Clade II, swept through countries such as the United States, where the illness had been mostly unknown despite years of outbreaks in Africa. Now Clade I, a different and deadlier strain of mpox, is spreading in populous Central African countries including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, and Ghana. According to the WHO, both versions of the viral infection spread through close human contact, including speaking face-to-face, as well as through contact with infected materials such as bedding or clothing. Symptoms of mpox include a rash of blisters or sores for 2 to 4 weeks, then fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy, and swollen lymph nodes. Victims of the 2022 outbreak in the United States generally saw symptoms resolve after a few weeks, but the strain currently spreading quickly in Africa has proven much deadlier, in part because vaccination supplies have not yet made it to the area in quantity.",

Friday, Aug. 23, is National Cheap Flight Day. This sacred event, which has been unofficially marked since 2015, commemorates the glorious season when airfare prices usually dip as summer begins to wrap up and, praise be, savings on plane tickets can occasionally be found after months of higher prices. Unfortunately, cheap flight season takes up only a little space on the calendar. After it's over, airfares steadily rise as the end-of-year holidays approach, reaching a peak around Thanksgiving. Unlike with other holiday-related phenomena (looking at you, Easter Bunny), you don't have to take the temporary decline in airfare prices on faith. Hard data from online travel agency CheapOair, a website that gets hyped up enough about the day to put out advance press releases, shows that since June 1, the average cost of a U.S. domestic airline ticket has decreased by 33.4%, while the price of tickets for international flights has dropped by 10%. What's more, those trends are expected to continue through August and September, according to CheapOair's analysis—suggesting the holiday isn't really a National Cheap Flight Day but a National Cheap Flight Month. “Summer is winding down and consumer focus is on returning to normal work and school schedules,\" explains Glenn Cusano, president of CheapOair parent corporation Fareportal, in a statement.",

Here's what multi-trip insurance is, how it works, and how to tell if it's the economical choice for you. For years you've heard it drilled into your brain: Always buy travel insurance for major trips. But even minor trips may involve big problems. Airlines and airports are halting operations without warning, political skirmishes are changing the landscape of no-go destinations, and, oh yeah, you could still get sick with Covid when you're scheduled to travel. Given how unreliable travel has become and how easy it is to get stranded between point A and point B, our new travel insurance advice could very well be simplified to three words: Always have it. There's actually a type of travel insurance that you only have to buy once a year. Multi-trip insurance will cover you, no matter where you go, for the length of the policy's validity period, which is usually a year. Buy this type of insurance once, and you'll be covered for all your trips for a full 12 months. Does multi-trip travel insurance save money? That's something you have to calculate based on who you are and what your travel habits are. \"The cost of single-trip products are often based on two factors: the age of the traveler and the cost of the trip,\" said Daniel Durazo of Allianz Travel Insurance, one of the largest players in the business. \"So as those factors go up or down, so does the cost of travel insurance.\"",

Obsessed with floating other divisions of the Walt Disney Company instead of tending to the fragile creative ecosystem that makes Disney so eternally beloved, the Disney parks have been forcing out long-serving staff members and their institutional knowledge, bleeding devoted customers with skyrocketing prices and fees, renovating heritage properties with dull contemporary trends, shutting down entire parks for months at a time, neglecting maintenance, and constructing new resorts that feel like cookie-cutter corporate chains rather than the thematic fantasias that earned Disney its position as a vacation champion.

Slapping slot machine screens, walking the Strip in flip-flops, subjecting stroller-age children to the debauchery of Fremont Street—there are a lot of things tourists do in Vegas that don’t make a lot of sense. But the heartbreaker is seeing visitors shell out at airport car rental desks because they assume driving a car around Las Vegas will be convenient and affordable. It isn’t. For one, free parking at just about every resort has been eliminated in the past few years, with only Treasure Island, Circus Circus, and Sahara as the Strip holdouts. Parking at the big casinos now costs as much as $40 a day. Getting in and out of those parking garages can be tedious, and out on the streets, Vegas drivers have a reputation for blowing red lights in “staggering” numbers, according to local officials. 2023 was one of the most deadly years for drivers in two decades, as reported by the Las Vegas Review Journal. Even when Las Vegas drivers are on their best behavior, driving still sucks. Between the endless construction-related detours and the now-annual gridlock-inducing preparations for the Formula 1 Grand Prix, it’s almost never worth the hassle to drive a rented car on your Vegas vacation.

Now Momondo is back on top, perhaps because of something to do with its merger with corporate cousin Kayak. (You now get exactly the same results from both Kayak and Momondo, but since Kayak leads its list with a “sponsored result” ad and Momondo’s design is easier on the eyes, Momondo gets top billing.) Momondo secured the best price a whopping six times, the second-best four times, and only dipped below average rates twice. Beyond price, Momondo has by far the most complete set of filters in the business, including a “Booking sites” list so you can weed out the results from shady OTAs, and it offers 13 ways to sort the results (compared to 3–8 elsewhere). You can even select or exclude aircraft types. The one filter that sets Momondo apart is the ability to select how many carry-on and checked bags you will bring so it can fold those fees into the price quotes. Only Kiwi and Google, way down at # 7 and #10 respectively, give you the same option, but the base airfares on those aren’t as low as they are on Momondo. Momondo has transitioned from pure aggregator (matchmaking customers with travel sellers) to include its own OTA selling its own tickets.

Planes were often less than half full, the company said, making the enterprise unsustainable. Tailwind Air continues to hold out hope for \"a deal that could bring seaplanes back for 2025,\" the newspaper reports. But for now, the scenic, speedy, spendy flights are grounded. One of the oldest airports in New York City is the East River.

Manhattan’s Skyport terminal at E. 23rd St. and FDR Drive is still in operation, though. Today, the marina is most commonly used for amphibious aircraft operating sightseeing tours and weekend jaunts to the Hamptons, according to the Wall Street Journal. In summer 2021, the Skyport also became one endpoint of the first regularly scheduled commercial seaplane service between New York and Boston in decades.

How to win an invitation to their little-known subculture\n\nIf you’re the kind of cruise passenger who loves finding generous discounts, you might want to take a moment before reading this next sentence. You’ve almost certainly sailed alongside passengers who have been invited to sail for free, lured onboard simply because they tend to visit casinos. Cruise lines are notoriously tight-lipped about precisely what might prompt them to extend passengers an offer for a free cruise (port fees and taxes still must be paid), but it’s happening. How to get a free cruise by gambling\n\n“It’s 100 percent about the spend. These free trips are offered to people the cruise lines see spending money in the casino,” says cruise expert Gary Bembridge, who founded the Tips for Travellers blog and has more than 443,000 subscribers for his YouTube channel. Bembridge regularly comes across passengers who’ve received this type of invitation. “On my last Holland America cruise, there was a group of 180 players who’d been invited on the sailing by the cruise line,” he says. Almost every cruise line with onboard casinos already runs a loyalty program that could translate into future invitations. For example, in Royal Caribbean’s Club Royale scheme, passengers earn one point for every $5 spent on slot machines and every $10 spent on video poker machines, and the line offers perks, including complimentary future cruises, for gamblers who reach 100,000 points.",

Last week, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) announced a rulemaking that would ban airlines from charging fees for parents and caregivers to sit with kids 13 and under. While the news was more than welcome, it was not unexpected: In May 2024, President Biden signed the FAA Reauthorization Act, whereby Congress specifically gave the DOT the power to force the airlines to stop the madness.

Because the event is so popular, there's no such thing as too early when it comes to planning to attend the festival. In fact, competition for places to stay can get fierce—if you're already finding that traditional hotels and rentals are full up, consider alternative lodging options such as campgrounds and accommodations in other cities nearby. What to Know About 2024 Oktoberfest in Munich\n\nThis year's Oktoberfest in Munich is slated to last from Sunday, September 21, through Sunday, October 6. If you're wondering why a celebration of October takes place mostly in September, blame the weather. While the festival did originally occur entirely in October when it was introduced in 1810, officials eventually moved the start date up to mid-September to take advantage of longer days and warmer temperatures. There are a lot of outdoor components, after all—carnival rides, parades, and such—and October comes with a nip in the air. Admission to Oktoberfest is free if you just want to walk around and soak up the atmosphere. If you want to soak up some suds, though, you will have to pay by the beer. In 2024, the cost of a serving ranges from €13.60 to €15.30 ($14.90–$16.76). Beers are served in elaborate tents—17 large ones and and 21 small ones.",

On Thursday, the Department of Transportation (DOT) announced that it has proposed a rule that forbids commercial airlines from charging families extra to be seated together. As American families know all too well, the biggest airlines have shamelessly converted the protection of your children into a profit center, slapping parents and guardians with seat reservation fees to guarantee they can sit by each other. Over the years, there have been reports of children as young as 2 being separated from their guardians by airline fee impositions. Some instances involved kids with special physical needs. Safety concerns aside, on airlines that charge seating reservation fees of $25 each, White House officials estimated, the change will save a family of four up to $200 roundtrip. \"The idea that parents ought to be seated next to their own children on a flight is common sense and also seems like something that ought to be standard practice,\" said DOT Secretary Pete Buttigieg when announcing the change to the press. \"We are requiring that an airline not charge you extra to sit next to your kids—or your grandkids. It applies to any accompanying adults,\" Buttigieg told CBS Mornings during his announcement.

The Bahamas, meanwhile, currently stands at level 2, \"Exercise Increased Caution,\" under the system. That hasn't changed since 2022, but the U.S. Embassy in the Bahamas did release a security alert in January about a crime wave, mostly related to gang violence. Government leaders and tourism officials from both island nations objected to the earlier advisories, arguing that the majority of travelers remain safe, particularly in resort areas. It's worth noting that Jamaica and the Bahamas aren't the only tourism heavy hitters in the region that the State Department hasn't given its lowest threat assessment score, level 1, indicating travelers should \"Exercise Normal Precautions.\" The Dominican Republic and Cuba are both at level 2; Trinidad & Tobago is at level 3.",

Last updated April 6, 2022\n\n\n\nAll U.S. citizens, including children, are required to obtain passports in their own names for identification while traveling abroad and for re-entry into the United States. Passports also satisfy the requirements for Real ID. Unless specifically authorized by a passport issuing office, no person may have more than one valid, or potentially valid, US passport of the same type at any one time. Following is a summary of the passport application process that was compiled from information provided by the U.S. State Department, which maintains a web site at travel.state.gov. You can download PDF versions of all applications through the official form finder at https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/form-finder.html. First-Time Passport Applications\n\nIf you are applying for your first U.S. Passport, you must apply in person at one of more than 5,000 facilities, such as Clerks of Court and Post Offices, which accept passport applications. To find your nearest acceptance facility, visit travel.state.gov or contact the National Passport Information Center at 877/487-2778. You will need to provide the following documents:\n\n1. One item of proof of United States citizenship or nationality such as: an expired U.S. passport, a certified copy of a birth certificate/ certificate of live birth (one issued from a government office, not a hospital; click here to find out how to obtain one) for all applicants born in the U.S., a Certificate of Naturalization, Certificate of Citizenship, or a Consular Report of Birth Abroad.

If you love to travel, sooner or later, you will need to show a government official your birth certificate to prove who you are. Birth certificates can unlock the ability to travel freely. They're accepted as a fundamental proof of citizenship for a variety of crucial documents that can validate you for worldwide travel, including first-time passports (but not renewals), Real ID driver's licenses that will be required of U.S. citizens in their airports and cruise ports starting in 2025, and even some types of visas. Birth certificates can be useful for all kinds of other paperwork, too, such as when you're applying for loans and buying property. But many of us have lost track of our birth certificates, or they've become dog-eared with age, or we were never given them to begin with. Not a problem. You can ask for a certified copy of your birth certificate, which for most purposes is just as legally valid as having the original. If you were born inside the USA\n\nThe U.S. State Department, which issues passports for U.S. citizens, says that if you were born in the United States, then a U.S. birth certificate qualifies as a form of proof of citizenship. A copy of your birth certificate (or a certificate of live birth, which is technically different but still accepted) will do for passport applications as long as it fulfills the following requirements:\n\n— Issued by the city, county, or state of birth\n\n— Lists your full name, date of birth, and place of birth\n\n— Lists your parent(s)’ full names\n\n— Bears the signature of the city, county, or state registrar\n\n— Includes the date it was filed with the registrar's office (must be within 1 year of birth)\n\n— Comes with the raised seal or stamp of the city, county, or state that issued the document\n\nDon't let that list stress you out—if you go through the correct channels to obtain a copy of your birth certificate, the certified copy you request should check those boxes.",

The item in question is an 8-foot-long chunk of elaborately carved balsa wood that now resides at eastern Tennessee's Titanic Museum Attraction, which rightly bills the panel in press materials as one of the most \"talked-about props in Hollywood history.\" In the movie, the wood panel—commonly referred to as a door, though it's not really—is a piece of debris from the sinking ship. Rose perches on the makeshift raft to avoid drowning or freezing in the icy North Atlantic Ocean, as her love interest, Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), clings to the edge while submerged up to his neck in the frigid waters. Many, many viewers have expressed an opinion that the famous flotsam was big enough to accommodate both young lovers, thereby saving a never-dreamier DiCaprio from the watery depths. We refuse to relitigate the matter, preferring to let the issue of the Titanic door's suitability for two dwell among the eternal mysteries of moviedom, right up there with the question of why the car flies at the end of Grease. For the record, the MythBusters TV show concluded in 2012 that both Jack and Rose could have survived on the piece of wood. The movie's director, James Cameron, disagrees. You're free to subject the Titanic panel to your own scrutiny at the Titanic Museum Attraction, a repository of artifacts and replicas housed in a structure built to resemble the ship itself in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, the Great Smoky Mountains town best known as the home of Dolly Parton's Dollywood theme park.",

Film buffs travel long distances to find theaters equipped for the increasingly prized movie format. When Oscar-winning director Christopher Nolan (Oppenheimer, Inception) introduced a 2019 nitrate screening of Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca at Hollywood's Egyptian Theatre, Nolan told the gathered spectators about the time he got to see Casablanca in nitrate after years of watching it in modern formats. \"It was just a transformative experience—a film I love and got to experience in a very different way,\" Nolan said. \"These screenings are all about seeing a work the way the filmmaker originally got to show it to the audience, the way the audience got to experience this great piece of work at the time.\" What is nitrate film and why is it rare? From the 1890s to the 1950s, pretty much every movie was printed on cellulose nitrate film. When we watch an old movie today, we're really watching a copy of a copy, sometimes many generations deep and often created without the benefit of the original negative as the source. That's why audiences often find the faces and details in many old films to be off-puttingly fuzzy and indistinct, and why the images in silent movies can be so mushy they feel like they're from another planet. But what filmgoers saw back in the day was much more detailed and crisp, thanks to resolution made possible by nitrate. The precision and contrast of movie images felt both intimate and spectacular, playing a big role in establishing cinema as a dominant entertainment form.",

But the minute Southwest Airlines announced that, after some 50 years, the carrier will do away with its open seating system, the online reaction seemed to repeat a certain point that rings true. You might hear it said that open seating was the best thing about flying Southwest. The lack of assigned seating made it easier for families to sit together without paying too much more. All you had to do was check in 24 hours before departure and secure an early boarding group—it was all about jostling for that A group. I personally found the boarding experience anxiety-inducing and dehumanizing, but millions of customers have felt it made Southwest easier and more affordable to use. Now Southwest has announced it will begin charging for seating assignments, and will deviate from its long-running system of seat equality to add seats with extra legroom, which will also come with an extra charge. Let's be honest. Southwest's no-class system had already deteriorated before today, eroded by cash grabs. The airline's \"EarlyBird\" check-in upcharge, available 36 hours before departure for $15 a person, was already infuriating customers who bought it, thinking the service would allow them to seat their entire families together, yet still finding themselves in group B. \"What's up?\" Denver TV host Jeff Schroeder asked Southwest on the air on July 16. \"What am I paying for? ... I'm paying to be average?\" Now, just like the other airlines, Southwest will charge you to access higher-quality versions of the same service.",

The seaside route connects the villages of Riomaggiore (pictured above) and Manarola via a curving, roughly 1km (0.6-mile) paved path that has been closed since 2012. A landslide in September of that year injured four tourists, reports the BBC, prompting officials to close the trail for extensive repairs.

Located in the desert town–turned–unlikely arts hub of Marfa (about 50 miles east of the Mexico border), the Blackwell School National Historic Site was formally established last week by the Biden administration, which has now designated a total of seven national park units since President Joe Biden took office. The Blackwell School's History: Segregation and Resilience\n\nThe Blackwell School National Historic Site comprises two buildings, including an original adobe structure that was erected in 1909 as an elementary school for the region's Mexican American children at a time when Texas schools were segregated by race. At so-called \"Mexican schools\" like this one, the Austin American-Statesman explains, teachers would forbid students of Mexican descent to speak their native language. In fact, first graders were instructed to \"bury Mr. Spanish\" in a mock funeral. Spanish speakers who slipped up could be punished with a wooden paddle, the newspaper reports. The Blackwell School remained open until 1965, when the Marfa Independent School District was finally integrated, according to the Associated Press. “Today’s designation of the Blackwell School as our nation’s newest national park ensures that the rich history and cultural heritage of this significant place is preserved for future generations,” said Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland in a statement. “This site is a powerful reminder of our nation’s diverse and often complex journey toward equality and justice. By honoring the legacy of Blackwell School, we recognize the resilience and contributions of the Latino community in our shared history.”\n\nThe effort to save and restore the school and to get it permanent federal protection was led by a group of former Blackwell students who formed a nonprofit known as the Blackwell School Alliance.",

It what must be the first for the head of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), Sec. Pete Buttigieg, took to multiple social media channels to remind travelers of their rights amid the crisis. On Saturday, on X, formerly Twitter, he reminded passengers that they no longer had to tolerate substandard refunds by the airlines. \"I am hearing reports of some airlines only offering flight credits to passengers for cancelled flights,\" Buttigieg posted. \"Let me be clear—you are entitled to get your money back promptly if your flight is cancelled and you don't take a rebooking.\" Buttigieg was referring to a new set of requirements for airlines that were instituted by the Department of Transportation earlier this year, shortly after the DOT collaborated on the rules in consultation with 18 states attorneys general. \"After 46 years, this is an historic first,\" Frommer's wrote when the new requirements were announced. But many American consumers apparently remained unaware of the new protections for significantly delayed flights. By Sunday, most airlines had reduced their disruptions to a minimum, but disruptions at Delta Air Lines remained problematic. So Buttigieg called the CEO of Delta Air Lines. \"I have made clear to Delta that we expect the airline to provide prompt refunds to consumers who choose not to be rebooked, and free rebooking and timely reimbursements for food and overnight hotel stays to consumers affected by the delays and cancellations, as well as adequate customer service assistance to all of their passengers,\" Buttigieg said in statement.",

Certain world events that we have all apparently agreed to rarely speak of delayed that debut voyage to October 2021, when the Scarlet Lady set sail for a series of departures packed with young influencer types who were invited to help the adults-only brand achieve liftoff as a bacchanalian boat with modern style. Virgin's reign as the up-all-night party cruise line seemed to last only as long as the weirdly named \"revenge travel\" trend. Once Covid-related pent-up demand began to subside, the average age of Virgin's passengers began to crawl upward, and the line redefined itself as a minimally intimidating cruise for all ages. To sustain itself for the long run, Virgin has had to pivot toward a broader market of \"young at heart\" customers, as Frommer's found when we took a Virgin Voyages cruise a few months ago. While the line's sailings remain adults-only, the brand is no longer exclusively the domain of selfie-snapping, midnight-boozing Gen Zers. We encountered a healthy mix of demographic groups going up to Gen X and into \"grandparenting age.\" But as the brand repositions itself in the market, Virgin still needs to fill berths, particularly in late summer when bookings can be softer due to concerns over hurricanes. That's why Virgin just announced a sale that's substantial enough for us to tell you about.

A century since it last hosted the games, Paris hosts the 2024 Summer Olympic Games from July 26 through August 11, with the Paralympics following from August 28 to September 8. After failing several times in recent decades to win the Games, Paris ultimately landed them by pitching an original twist. Instead of being confined to dedicated sporting venues, many events will be held at Paris’s most iconic sites, including archery at Les Invalides, skateboarding in Place de la Concorde, and beach volleyball beneath the Eiffel Tower. The River Seine will also feature prominently, first during the opening ceremonies, when 10,000 athletes are expected to sail on it aboard 170 boats, and later for some aquatic competitions.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is rolling out new rules for bringing a dog into the United States. Effective August 1, all dogs entering the country must be at least 6 months old, must be microchipped, and must be accompanied by either proof of a rabies vaccine or proof that the dog hasn't been in a country considered high-risk for rabies over the last 6 months. Additionally, the dog will need to \"appear healthy upon arrival,\" and the owner will need to present a receipt verifying online submission of the CDC Dog Import Form. Up to now, bringing a dog into the U.S. has not, in most cases, required presenting rabies vaccination documentation. A pet owner just had to provide a written or verbal statement that the dog had not been in a high-risk country for rabies within the past 6 months. There was previously no age minimum or microchip requirement for dogs, either. The tightened restrictions are intended to \"prevent the re-introduction of dog rabies into the United States,\" the federal agency stated when announcing the change in May. The virus was eliminated in the U.S. in 2007, but the CDC grew alarmed about the potential for the return of dog rabies amid a surge in international pet adoptions during the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2021, the CDC temporarily suspended the importation of dogs from more than 100 countries with a high risk of rabies. With the August 1 introduction of the updated dog-entry rules, the former suspension will finally end—but the trade-off is having more stringent entry regulations.",

For visitors keen on getting unobstructed, scaffolding-free views of, among other sites, the Pantheon, the Fountain of the Four Rivers, or the Colosseum, here’s a hard truth: 2024 might not be your year. Why is there so much construction in Rome right now? The reason so much of Rome is walled off or under scaffolding this year is due to what’s happening next year: the Vatican's Jubilee of 2025. The yearlong event, which kicks off on December 24, 2024, is billed by the Catholic Church as “a special year of grace,” where the faithful have the chance to obtain a plenary indulgence, or washing away of sins as if the believer were freshly baptized anew. Jubilees take place every 25 years, and are marked by the opening of the otherwise closed Holy Doors of Rome’s four papal basilicas: St. Peter’s Basilica, the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran, Santa Maria Maggiore, and St. Paul Outside the Walls.

One thing is for sure: It's a waste of money if you use it the wrong way. The app-based Lightning Lane service, which was introduced as Genie+ at Disney's American theme parks in late 2021 and revised in July 2024, evokes dread in casual visitors to the self-billed Happiest Place on Earth. People who choose to vacation at a Disney park already struggle to navigate high costs and crowds. Lightning Lane Multi Pass, which purports to help guests plan the best times to enjoy attractions, adds yet another layer of complexity to deciphering the Disney system. We've gone on record to call Lightning Lane a scam because it pushes vacationers to hand over money for something that used to be free. The need for Lightning Lane is flimsy at best. The only reason guests feel the need to buy access to this special line is because so many other people buy it—if fewer people did that, the free Standby line would move more briskly. The price of that Lightning Lane benefit changes depending on how busy the parks are projected to be. At Florida's Walt Disney World, Lightning Lane Multi Pass rates can now be as much as $25 to $39 a day. At California's Disneyland resort, it's up to $30 per day. That price is per person and per day, whether you're a child or an adult. For single-day visits, Lightning Lane slots become available via the Disney theme park app at 7am 3 three days ahead, so if you're a spontaneous person who doesn't buy your theme park tickets that far ahead, you will find a limited selection of ride times by the day of your visit.",

Unnoticed by many casual travelers, the volume of an allowed carry-on bag on some popular airlines has been cut as much as 55% since 2018, the BBC reports. The worst offender so far, according to the BBC, is the Ireland-based no-frills carrier Ryanair, which slashed allowed proportions from 55 x 40 x 20cm (21.6 x 15.7 x 7.8 inches) in 2018 to just 40 x 20 x 25cm (15.7 x 7.8 x 9.8 inches) in 2024. To give you a sense of how small that is, a men's size 9 shoe in the U.S. measures about 27 cm—which is too long for what the airline now allows. Other airlines caught quietly slashing size limits include easyJet and Wizz Air, two more popular carriers for affordable European flights. The reduced capacity has turned previously acceptable pieces of luggage into cash cows for the airlines. Passengers who have used the same luggage for years are arriving at the airport to discover their bags are no longer acceptable without added fees. \"The reduced allowances mean many common carry-on bags that would have been fine just a few years ago are now too large to bring on board without paying extra fees,\" Emma Coulthurst of the vacation price comparison site TravelSupermarket told journalists covering the story in the United Kingdom.

All the major cruise lines now maintain at least one privately managed beach destination in the Caribbean that is used as a port of call to keep a day's worth of tourist spending safely inside the company. In 2018, our founder, Arthur Frommer, called cruise line private islands \"extortion on a cruise whose price I have already paid,\" but that hasn't abated their rise or popularity, since they give cruisers a resort-like environment to enjoy without worrying about currency conversions or crime rates. This year, Disney added a second bespoke destination to increase its capacity for Caribbean cruises. In June, the company opened Disney Lookout Cay at Lighthouse Point, an enclave on the island of Eleuthera in the Bahamas. Immediately, travelers began complaining about nakedly exposed walkways, swarms of flies, and a grueling layout that required visitors to slog down a marathon pier before they could even get to land. \"This adventure required a half-mile walk on a pier under the blazing Bahamas sun, followed by waiting with a crowd to ride a 10-minute tram to reach the main area of the park,\" wrote Travel Weekly, an industry publication that's not prone to hyperbole.",

Depending on the destination and the type of cruise, there are many options for ocean journeys that don’t require a passport even though they go to international destinations in the Caribbean, Mexico, and Canada. We’ve rounded up some of your best bets for passport-free cruises at home and abroad. How to Cruise Internationally Without a Passport: Book a \"Closed-Loop\" Cruise\n\nA “closed-loop” cruise is a round-trip voyage that begins and ends in the same U.S. port. As U.S. Customs and Border Protection explains, U.S. citizens do not need a valid passport to take a closed-loop cruise, even if the ship makes stops at foreign ports of call along the way, provided those stops are in the Western Hemisphere. For an example, the federal agency states that if you board a cruise ship in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and, after visiting, say, Bermuda or Mexico’s Caribbean coast, the ship returns to Fort Lauderdale, you’ve taken a closed-loop cruise. No passport required. “However,” the agency continues, “if you board a cruise ship in San Diego, California, sail through the Panama Canal (stopping at a foreign port during the cruise), and end the cruise in Miami, Florida, you have not taken a closed loop cruise.” Every passenger on board will need a valid passport, even though the voyage starts and ends in the United States.",

Paris' miserable Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG) is a bane of world travel, particularly for flight transfers. A dysfunctional layout, awkward connections, lousy signage, alienating Brutalist architecture, and crowds of grumpy international travelers who don't speak your language—the airport may be the perfect embodiment of the pompous politico it's named for. The French countryside may be calming and lovely, but you'll have to pay a heavy toll to see it if you arrive at CDG. Nonetheless, CDG has been unavoidable for many North American travelers because so many transatlantic airlines use it. Plus, the aiport has the easiest ground transportation links to Paris (about an hour). At least, that used to be true. Another airport in Paris just became much cheaper and faster to reach than Charles de Gaulle. On June 24, 3 years ahead of its originally announced opening date, Line 14 of the Paris Métro subway system christened a new extension that stops directly at Paris-Orly Airport. Now automated Métro trains depart from a new Orly station every 3–5 minutes and take just 30 minutes to reach the Pyramides stop in the middle of Paris. Unlike the previously existing rail option at Orly, it's a one-seat journey from airport to town, and the fare is typically just €10.30 (US$11.23). Before \"Ligne 14\" expanded, getting ground transportation from Orly required road vehicles or the cumbersome OrlyVal shuttle/train combination (pictured below; €14.10 or $15.37) that could take an hour or longer—and is now much slower and more expensive than the new Métro option.",

The Sphere (255 Sands Ave.), simply called Sphere by the people who run it, opened in the summer of 2023 at a reported cost of $2.3 billion and became an instant landmark. Its exterior is covered with 1.2 million multi-color LED lights that are programmed to create ever-changing, awe-inspiring displays. Abstract art, trompe l’oeil, and occasional advertising campaigns swirl across the surface, with the brightest images lighting up around sunset and usually culminating in a recreation of the moon by late night. The effect is both exhilarating and hypnotic, like the world’s most intense screen saver, but one with a sense of humor. But the interior of Sphere is a tourist draw of its own: a massive event venue of up to 17,000 seats across nine levels for concerts and movies. It's being promoted as “the most technologically advanced performance space in the city” based on features including a wraparound LED screen at 16K, the highest resolution in the world at a scale like this, and mechanisms to create \"4-D\" immersive shows using enhanced sound, wind, and aromas.

Last summer, Holland America Line rolled out an enticing, novel proposition for cruisers. In exchange for deep discounts, uber-flexible, adventurous travelers can pay upfront to be added to a standby list for a specific voyage from eligible sailings. If a spot opens up on the cruise, standby passengers are notified that the gamble paid off—though with as little as 2 days' notice in some cases. (Holland America says the standard window is 2 to 7 days before departure; cruisers report the range is typically more like 2 to 5 days.) The Standby Program, which the cruise line recently expanded to a larger number of eligible sailings, launched with advertised rates as low as $49 per day. Prices are currently $99 per day for an inside or ocean view stateroom, or $129 per day for a Verandah stateroom.

In the late 1920s, the Empire State Building, 40 Wall Street, and the Chrysler Building were all being constructed in Manhattan. Architects for each of the three buildings were desperate to claim the title of the world's tallest skyscraper. The Chrysler and 40 Wall each added some new levels to ensure they'd be the one to claim the crown, but then the Chrysler surprised everyone by installing its gleaming sculptural steel ornament as a topper, winning the race to the sky. But when the construction of the Empire State Building wrapped up just 12 months later, competitors were horrified to see that designers had added a zeppelin mast to the top of the newest structure, qualifying it as the height champ. Despite the Chrysler's temporary victory, the Empire State Building was the tallest building in the world for 40 years. Something similar is afoot in Orlando, Florida.

For the last few months, ocean researchers have been tracking a huge blob of the stuff floating in the Atlantic Ocean and headed westward in time to ruin summer vacation photos in places like Cancún, the Dominican Republic, and South Florida. In addition to marring a beach's appearance, the macroalgae is expensive to remove and tends to smell like rotten eggs when it starts decomposing on shore. That's because as it rots it produces hydrogen sulfide gas, the Florida Department of Health explains, potentially irritating the eyes, nose, and throat when inhaled, especially if you have asthma or other breathing issues. Touching sargassum itself doesn't cause skin problems such as stinging or rashes, experts say, though tiny organisms living in the seaweed might.

As states eliminate tollbooth workers so cars can zoom through sensor points using transponders, tourists get shafted.

Going by the number of lifeguard rescues, the biggest hazard at the beach—by far—is encountering a rip current. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), rip currents prompt more than 80% of rescues at surf beaches (i.e., any coastal areas where waves break). Powerful channels of water that can rapidly pull swimmers away from the shore and out to sea, rip currents also account for over 100 drownings each year in the U.S., according to the United States Lifesaving Association. And in recent years, that number has been ticking upward, per government data. News reports of multiple drownings and scores of beach rescues within the span of a single week are not uncommon. Experts cite several reasons for the heightened risk—everything from a shortage of lifeguards (particularly on Florida's Gulf Coast) paired with higher numbers of beachgoers, to more intense storms and climate change (though NOAA is still looking into whether there's a connection between rip currents and warming waters, agency officials told USA Today). Anyone planning to swim while at the beach should know about rip currents—how to spot them, how dangerous it can be to disregard posted warnings, and how to escape should you suddenly find yourself subject to the mighty pull of the sea. What are rip currents and why are they so dangerous? As the National Weather Service explains, rip currents are channels of water that flow from near the shore to past the point where waves break.",

The natural splendor of Acadia National Park, the renowned culinary scene of Portland, and the seaside charms of places such as the Kennebunks, Camden, and Ogunquit all get their due. But readers of Frommer's Maine Coast get a leg up on other travelers, thanks to invaluable intel on what's new and noteworthy in the region. And what's new and noteworthy in the region? • Certainly not the large peak-season crowds at Acadia, though the local response to managing the summer and autumn hordes has evolved over the last few years. The national park's seasonal reservation system (in place through Oct. 27 this year) had only recently made its debut the last time Frommer's published a Maine guide. But advance bookings for driving the park's Cadillac Summit Road are now firmly entrenched and appear to be a perennial feature, according to Kevin.",

Flying in the summer always presents challenges. But flying this summer promises to be particularly challenging. Airlines are already dealing with tremendous stress, including pent-up demand and delivery delays on new aircraft. Now, we have to add record-setting heat waves. The effect of hot weather on airlines is much more significant than most passengers know. Here’s what to expect, what to know, and how to avoid flight delays and cancellations. Summer heat affects aircraft\n\nThe fact is jet engines simply don’t like heat. Hot weather produces lower air density, which means those powerful engines sometimes cannot suck in sufficient air for combustion and propulsion. Thinner air density can have negative effects on performance, efficiency, and fuel consumption. In the heat, airplane engines may require more takeoff distance to counteract the thinner air. Longtime airline colleagues assure me that jet engine technology has greatly improved in recent years, so some hot weather problems of the past have dissipated. But not entirely. What does this mean for passengers? Plenty. I haven’t used my FAA aircraft dispatcher license in many years, but I vividly recall being faced with tough decisions on very hot days to mitigate diminished takeoff performance resulting from extreme heat. • bump passengers to reduce takeoff weight\n\n• bump baggage to reduce takeoff weight\n\n• delay the flight until temperatures drop\n\n• schedule a fuel stop en route (which delays arrival and potentially creates a cascade effect of missed connections)\n\n• cancel the flight outright\n\nObviously, none of these options are good for passengers.",

But while trying to satisfy those worthwhile ends, some hacks go viral on message boards, travel sites, and, especially, TikTok, by proposing solutions that may be, depending on the hack, ineffective, unproven, overcomplicated, against the rules, or downright dangerous.

On Friday, Barcelona mayor Jaume Collboni announced that the city intends to invalidate the licenses of all 10,101 units currently approved as short-term vacation rentals, and no new licenses will be issued. The national housing minister expressed support for the idea. \"From 2029, the tourist apartment as it is currently known will disappear from Barcelona,\" Collboni said. As a compromise, the mayor will relax a ban on opening new hotels in the city center. The vacation rental cleansing will be complete by November 2028. In Spain's most tourist-packed city, runaway vacation rentals have been squeezing out local residents for years—The New Yorker dubbed Barcelona's problem \"the Airbnb Invasion\" in 2019. In the past decades, the cost of renting a home rose 68%, and the cost of buying one jumped by 38%. The city government has been fighting a rising tide of vacation rentals that locals complain has altered the traditional residential character of the center of Barcelona. In recent years, Barcelona has forced the closing of 9,700 unlicensed apartment rentals and recovered 3,473 units to the rental market for permanent residents. Locals and resident-focused businesses have been forced out of Barcelona's center by economic imbalances caused by vacation rentals. The effects on La Rambla, the city's famous avenue that leads from the port, have been so extreme that authorities are now spending €55.6 million (US$59.5 million) to redesign the street to make it more inviting to foot traffic and hopefully prop up sagging businesses.",

Until the early 1980s, it was standard for passengers to be asked by a security representative in the baggage claim area to match the code number on their checked-bag receipt to prove their checked bags belonged to them. In those days, the claim check was often the perforated stub of the luggage tag. That way, the airlines knew that each piece of luggage went home with the person who checked it. It's past time for some simple luggage security to return to baggage claim. Just look at some recent headlines, which reveal a consistent and global problem with the major airlines' safe custody of our baggage. * As the Los Angeles Times reported on Wednesday, A woman's luggage didn't make it on to her recent American Airlines flight to Burbank, California. After five days with no news, American finally told her it found the bag and would take care of the issue—but then it delivered the wrong bag to her. So the passenger tracked her stuff down with an Apple AirTag. The passenger told KTLA, a local TV station, that she went to the location of the AirTag to check things out. \"That day I saw dozens of suitcases, brand new suitcases, name-brand suitcases strewn across Western and Sunset,” she said. “Rows and rows of suitcases, bicycles, baby strollers with airline tags on them everywhere.”\n\nHow do \"dozens\" of suitcases move undetected from an airport baggage claim 10 miles away, even traveling around a mountain range that's in between?",

Use of the overhead bins required purchasing a different fare. But starting Sept. 6, Blue Basic also entitles each passenger to one carry-on bag that fits in the cabin's overhead bins and meets these specifications from JetBlue's baggage policy webpage: \"Carry-on bags must not exceed 22\" L (55.88 cm) x 14\" W (35.56 cm) x 9\" H (22.86 cm), including wheels and handles.\" Taking advantage of the new carry-on allowance depends, of course, on whether there's still room in the overhead bins to accommodate the bags of passengers with Blue Basic tickets by the time those flyers get on the plane. As JetBlue points out in its announcement, \"Blue Basic customers remain the final group to board.\" So \"in the event of space constraints, [Blue Basic] customers may be required to check carry-on bags at the [departure] gate for no additional charge.\" At least it's free.

The good news: A new digital renewal process is on the way, and you can sign up now. Although the event didn't get a lot of attention at the time, in December 2021 President Joe Biden signed a new executive order that will allow Americans to renew their passports online in a matter of days (see Sec. 4 of the official text). That development is a big deal for regular travelers because until now, when a passport reached the end of its validity, citizens had to mail the old booklet to the government and wait weeks or months for a renewal. Many countries require a passport to be valid for at least six months past your visit dates, so waiting until you have six months or fewer left will make it impossible to visit some destinations. But if you start your renewal at the one-year mark, which is the earliest the State Department will allow you to begin renewal, you'll ensure that you'll get your new booklet with enough time and space to keep it valid for most places. Think of an adult U.S. passport as being good for nine years, not 10, because that final year before expiration is fraught with validity exceptions, and renewals are currently prone to delays. Based on this timeline, we recommend that you begin your passport renewal process when your existing document has one year to nine months left on its validity. Any later than that, and you risk not receiving your new passport in time to visit a country with a six-month validity rule.",

But when you embark on a cruise ship, you're also often saying goodbye to your favorite TV shows and sporting events, and not everyone craves a full suspension of their daily reality. Regular cruise passengers know that the TV in your stateroom usually isn't capable of showing you much other than a few random third-tier channels cycling through the same old programming from yesteryear.

A new study conducted by researchers with the German Aerospace Center's Institute of Aerospace Medicine found that the combination of alcohol and reduced air pressure onboard a plane poses a \"significant\" risk to the health of sleeping passengers—even when the drinking is moderate and the drinkers are young and otherwise healthy. What happens, the scientists say, is that alcohol and the drop in atmospheric pressure cause a reduction in the oxygen level of blood as well as an increase in heart rate. Sleeping during a flight already exacerbates the fall in blood oxygen saturation, according to the study. Throwing in even a moderate level of booze—the simulation for the lab tests used the equivalent of two cans of beer or two glasses of wine—send blood oxygen saturation levels even lower, putting people at risk of something called hypoxemia, which can involve a rapid heart rate, difficulty breathing, and more serious outcomes, particularly in older people or those with preexisting heart or lung conditions. The study found, however, that even young and healthy individuals experienced a \"significant strain on the heart\" during tests. Larger quantities of alcohol than the amounts analyzed could intensify the effects. And sleep quality suffered, too. Eva-Maria Elmenhorst, one of the scientists who led the research, told NBC News that the team was “surprised to see that the effect was so strong.”\n\nThe study ends with an eye-opening conclusion: \"Our findings strongly suggest that the inflight consumption of alcoholic beverages should be restricted.\"",

It has been in business since 1990, first under the name OceanAir, then SATA Air Açores. The current name has been on the letterhead since 2020. The airline operates year-round flights from Boston, New York City, and Toronto to its home base in the Azores capital, Ponta Delgada. Many flights then continue on to Porto on Portugal's mainland and to the island of Madeira. In the summer months, Azores Airlines operates direct flights from the U.S. to those latter two destinations and, this summer, to the Italian city of Milan with a stop in Ponta Delgada on the way. The stopover program allows passengers to get off the plane and spend 7 days in the Azores before continuing on to Madeira or the European mainland without having to buy another ticket. The airline's prices are often, though not always, the lowest available. Looking at fares for this summer between New York City and Porto, I found that the carrier was usually $200 to $400 cheaper than Portugal’s national airline, TAP Air Portugal, but on par with what Delta Air Lines and Air France were charging for the same route—although the competitions' flights included a stop in Paris, rather than a nonstop flight.",

But the association has worked out just fine for Martha’s Vineyard, the Massachusetts island that played Amity in the wildly successful 1975 film adaptation of Peter Benchley’s bestselling novel. In return for supplying the thriller’s scenic seaside setting, the island received a tourism boom with an impact lasting into the present day, nearly five decades after Jaws smashed box office records, becoming the prototypical summer blockbuster, redefining Hollywood’s business model, and sparking Lord-only-knows-how-many freakouts in the minds of ocean swimmers who felt seaweed brushing against a leg and thought they were about to become fish food. Thanks to what the Martha’s Vineyard Chamber of Commerce calls “the Jaws Effect,” the island became a “set-jetting” destination before that was a thing. Because the movie was filmed almost entirely on location, fans quickly figured out there was an easy way to feel like they were visiting the picturesque set of their favorite movie. Of course, a lot of water has passed under the American Legion Memorial aka Jaws Bridge since the film’s famously fraught location shoot in 1974.

(Stigull Stairway at Via Ferrata Loen in western Norway | Photos: Kjersti Kvamme)\n\nThe spine-tingling ladder is the latest addition to Via Ferrata Loen, one of those mountainous routes involving steel structures such as ladders, bridges, rungs, and hooks that are supposed to make the thrills of climbing accessible to daredevils who yearn to scale mighty peaks but don't have much experience. As Frommer's explained in a 2022 roundup of via ferrata routes in the U.S., they're \"part climbing, part hiking, and part scrambling,\" with \"the adventure—and some of the bragging rights—of mountain climbing without the same degree of danger or the need to lug around heavy gear.\" (You will need to rent a helmet and harness from the tour company you hire.) Similarly, taking on the Stigull Stairway in Norway requires only \"moderate physical fitness,\" according to the press release, and a need to horrify your mom, according to us.",

        "text": "According to the National Association of Home Builders, there are 7.5 million second homes in the United States, which is 5.11% of the total number of homes. Yet even in this age of busy rental platforms like Airbnb, 65% of them are never listed on the major rental sites, mostly because their owners would rather not rent to strangers. But that could soon change for some of them thanks to a new website that makes renting a home feel safer. Brent Hieggelke, one of the founders of Trustr, told me that most second homes are viewed more as personal investments than rental properties, so they sit empty 10 to 11 months a year. \"Many second home owners would be open to sharing or renting them, but only to people that they know and trust,\" said Hieggelke. \"Trustr is the first platform built for these owners, allowing them to create a listing visible only to their curated guest list. It provides the peace of mind they need to share and rent their property.”\n\nTo that end, Trustr, which debuts June 5, works on several access tiers. At the first tier (called Private Listing—Free Edition), home owners can create a rental listing for their second home for free and send its URL to up to 10 friends and family members. That will be the limit of their access of the Trustr site, though. The next level up (Private Listing—Unlimited) allows the renter to send out as many links as they want. At this level, Trustr will also feature semi-private listings, which allow renters to post a summary of their home either to their direct social network (friends), or to a more extended network (friends and friends of friends).",

Even though it began sailing in the midst of the global Covid-19 pandemic, Virgin’s low-key party cruises to Bimini and Beyond were an instant hit. In the early days, the highlight of a Virgin cruise was a stop at the Bimini islands of the Bahamas, where guests could party at the new Virgin Voyages Beach Club, featuring celebrity DJs and lots of daybeds for luxurious lounging. The stop at Virgin Voyages’ private beach defined the new brand’s party aesthetic. Rowdier than Royal Caribbean, classier than Carnival, and younger than Holland America, Virgin beckoned to a hipper tier of guests: millennials who wouldn’t normally go on a crowded, mass-market cruise. Virgin Voyages cruises are open to guests aged 18 and over only, so there are no kids running around, and frequent Virgin Voyages cruisers are even referred to by the company as “RockStars.”\n\nVirgin’s prices can seem higher than comparable cruises, but the numbers work out in the end. For example, tip-fatigued Americans rejoice in the fact there are no gratuities on Virgin ships. A lot is included, such as group exercise classes and basic beverages including sodas. There are no buffets (although the line’s The Galley has cafeteria-style prepared food ready to serve—crew simply hands dishes to you), and there is no additional cost for eating at any of the specialty dining restaurants on board. These changes from the mid-priced industry norm sound great, but the question remains: How many hip millennials are there who would honestly want to take a cruise at all?",

The deadline for all Americans to be using Real I.D., the strengthened identification format that was announced in 2005 during the George W. Bush administration after the security disasters of September 11, 2001, has been affirmed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Americans must not really need safer identification at airports and federal buildings that badly, because the repeated delay of Real ID's eternally approaching deadline has become one of the most reliable running jokes in travel. Previously announced \"deadlines\" for either states or travelers to comply have included December 31, 2009; May 11, 2011; January 15, 2013; October 1, 2021; and September 30, 2021. In December 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) pushed the deadline from May 3, 2023, to May 7, 2025. In a statement explaining the umpteenth easement, DHS wrote, \"progress over the past two years has been significantly hindered by state driver’s licensing agencies having to work through the backlogs created by the pandemic.\" And less than a year before the final implementation of Real I.D., that date appears to be sticking. If this new date for Real ID compliance holds, babies who were born when Real I.D. was originally imagined will be old enough to be traveling with babies of their own by the time it's finally in place. We'll have gotten a whole new Star Wars trilogy, two new Avatar movies, and two new Indiana Jones sequels in the time it's taken. The concept behind Real ID was to standardize the types of proof that are required to obtain state-issued identification.",

The staff knows your name and preferred choice of water (sparkling) as well as your nightly choice of pre-dinner cocktail. There are very few times when you’ll have to charge anything to your room or have to pay for extras because pretty much everything is covered in the (high) price of the cruise, including a selection of excursions in every port. (Note that meals at specialty restaurants do cost extra.) Plus, there are fewer passengers on a luxury cruise than on the monster megaships, so not only is the service more attentive but also you may have a better chance of getting to know your fellow passengers. Needless to say, the prices reflect all this indulgence. As passengers have come to expect from ultra-luxury cruise line Silversea, the company’s 11th ship, Silver Nova, is an elegant ship with excellent food and wine as well as nearly flawless service. Nonetheless, there are notable changes aboard the first of Silversea’s Nova class vessels. Silver Nova, which debuted in August 2023, is billed as one of the most spacious cruise ships ever built due to a design meant to give more elbow room per passenger. The crew-to-guest ratio, meanwhile, is nearly one-to-one, with butler service in every suite underscoring the sense of luxe, attentive comfort. I sailed on Silver Nova’s weeklong inaugural voyage (at the invitation of the cruise line) from Vancouver, Canada, to Seward, Alaska, in early May 2024.",

Bag a shoulder season deal\n\nIn travel, shoulder season is the period between peak season and low season, and you’ll find it in cruising, too. Cruise lines don’t only offer consistently lower prices during shoulder season sailings—they’ll typically offer regular flash sales during these times, too. “Keep an eye out for flash sales during shoulder seasons,” says Elaine Warren, founder of specialist cruise travel agency FamilyCruiseCompanion.com. “Cruise lines are desperate to fill ships during these times. I've found some real steals by being ready to book as soon as I see a great offer pop up.”\n\nBear in mind that different regions have different shoulder seasons. In Alaska, for example, the main shoulder seasons are April and early May, and then at the end of summer between September and mid-October. Europe’s shoulder seasons are April and May, and then again in September to November. For Caribbean cruises, it’s May, June, and July and then in December, January, and March. Try to book at least six months in advance\n\nPassionate cruisers Don and Heidi Bucolo, founders of top cruise blog EatSleepCruise.com, say that advance booking can be a key to great deals. “Our advice is to book cruises between 6 and 12 months in advance. Typically, cruise prices tend to go up closer to the sail date, especially for newer ships or for more desirable travel dates.”\n\nConsider repositioning cruises\n\nRepositioning cruises are one-way sailings during which ships relocate from one region to another, like when they switch between summer Europe sailings to a winter Caribbean schedule.",

There are lots of places across the United States where you can pay tribute to the country’s great inventors and innovators. But very few, if any, of those institutions serve tequila (which is something to consider, Thomas Edison National Historical Park). A notable exception to that norm is Mariano’s Hacienda, the Mexican restaurant in Dallas that was the birthplace of the frozen margarita machine. The appliance was created more than 50 years ago, in 1971. Just think of all the happy hours, bachelorette parties, and hangovers it has made possible in the decades since then. The mind boggles. No, wait—that’s just brain freeze. The machine’s creator, Mariano Martinez, figures he deserves some credit for the nation’s birth rate, too. “One guy told me, ‘I think you’ve been responsible for more kids than all the fertility clinics in the country put together,’” Martinez told Frommer’s over the phone in May 2021, when his invention was turning 50. Since opening his first restaurant, Martinez (pictured above in 1979 with then-and-now images of his frozen margarita) has expanded his operation to several more establishments in the Dallas area, of which five remain.

It's almost as if the corporations dominating our lives are determined to make back whatever they missed during the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic. The cost of living is spiraling upward in multiple areas of Americans' lives, but that didn't stop American Airlines from piling on the misery by springing another fee hike on consumers. Travelers awoke on February 20, 2024, to discover they will now pay $40 to check a single bag on American Airlines, with a $5 discount for reserving ahead online. The price for a second checked bag jumped to $45. The change constitutes a $5-per-bag hike; the fee was previously $30 for the first bag and $40 for a second. The fee covers flights within the domestic United States, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. For flights to and from Canada, the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America, and Guyana, the first bag on American Airlines is now $35 and the second costs $45, no matter when or where the fee is paid. According to CNBC, the last time American Airlines hiked bag fees was in September 2018. While the price of checking a bag jumped by nearly 15%, the penalty for overweight baggage on American Airlines was reduced. Instead of paying a fee of $100 on checked bags that are as much as 3 pounds over a 50 pound limit, passengers will now pay an extra $30. But that's not all. In an effort to force more customers to book through the American Airlines website instead of a third party, the airline announced that tickets purchased through some travel agencies will no longer be eligible to accrue AAdvantage frequent flyer points.",

Occupancy and prices are down some 20–30% in the popular West Maui resort area, but those rates are expected to rebound by the end of 2024. They're lower than normal because of the lingering misperception that this sunny region, which is located just north of the fire-struck town of Lahaina, either doesn't want tourism or can't host it yet. But those perceptions are not true. Those who viewed the unforgettable images of Lahaina's fire-ravaged Front Street in August 2023 should be aware that key attractions on the town's northern end have all recently reopened, including Aloha Mixed Plate and Mala Ocean Tavern restaurants, Old Lahaina Luau, Lahaina Cannery Mall (home to the Lahaina Plantation Museum and a weekly arts and crafts fair), and Maui Ku‘ia Estate Chocolate Factory (which has cacao farm tour, tastings, and a weekly benefit for Maui fire relief.)

At least 9 of the coolest, most-visited reserves across the country (we list them here) now require would-be visitors to make advance reservations to access all or part of the parks. It's not as if the National Park Service is making it simple. Each park sets its own rules about when advance bookings open. For example, Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado begins taking bookings a month in advance for the following month from late May to late October. Meanwhile, Arches National Park in Utah (pictured above) opts for the Taylor Swift-via-Ticketmaster, mistake-waiting-to-happen pig-pile of opening reservations on the first day of the month that falls three months ahead of dates between April and October. And even then, you'll have to pay another $2 to secure the reservation, which is on top of the usual entry charge. It's hard to keep it all straight, and harder still to plan so far ahead every time. So if you fail to obtain a reservation for the day you want to go, you're forgiven. It can all be so bewildering.

For the period from June 1 to Nov. 30, the U.S. government's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicts \"above-normal hurricane activity\" in the Atlantic basin, which includes the North Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico. By season's end, NOAA expects 17 to 25 named storms (with wind speeds of 39 mph or higher). Of those, eight to 13 are predicted to become hurricanes (with winds of 74 mph or higher), and four to seven could become major hurricanes (with winds of 111 mph or higher). As the Boston Globe points out, the forecast's total number of named storms is the highest NOAA has ever predicted in its 154-year history. The historical average is 14 named storms. Last year saw an \"above-normal\" 20, according to NOAA. That gave 2023 the fourth-highest total since 1950. (A September 2023 satellite image of Hurricane Lee and Tropical Storm Margot appears at the top of this page.) Weather watchers say conditions in 2024 recall the destructive year of 2005, when a record-setting 28 named storms and 15 hurricanes developed, including Hurricane Katrina and six more that made landfall. The main reason why Caribbean islands and the U.S. Atlantic coastline appear to be in for an especially turbulent hurricane season in 2024: unprecedented sea surface temperatures in the eastern and central Atlantic Ocean.

Getting into airline lounges can make or break the comfort of your travel experience, especially when you're about to embark on a long flight. But the Shangri-La behind the magic sliding doors of the VIP zone doesn’t have to be reserved for those in the most expensive seats on the plane. You can still tuck into restaurant-style meals and a bottomless cocktail menu before you have to squeeze in with the other sardines on the plane. Here’s how. Buy a lounge membership\n\nLounge access comes in many forms. The most straightforward way to visit an airline lounge (at least in the U.S., Canada, and Australia) is by paying for lounge membership. Depending on the airline, that can cost between around $500 and $1,495 (Delta Air Line’s ambitiously exorbitant new cost for an executive membership permits two guests). Sums like that only makes sense for the most frequent of flyers with a particular airline. Earn elite status\n\nAnother way to gain access to the lounge on international trips is by holding a certain type of loyalty status with an airline or its affiliated partners or alliance. For example, a Delta flyer with SkyTeam Elite Plus status would be able to access a KLM lounge when traveling through Amsterdam, no matter what cabin their ticket is for. American Airlines' top-tier elite members holding Oneworld Emerald and Sapphire status would have similar lounge access in many airports when flying internationally. That's one of the main benefits of status, and there have been so many qualified passengers that it's no longer uncommon to find long lines at airport lounges, which have become so popular that many have wait lists to get in, even for just a few minutes of rest before takeoff.",

The airlines in question are Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines, two no-frills carriers that, up to now, have been infamous for their many fees. In a press release trumpeting the price reform measures, Frontier all but admitted that its prices have not been transparent previously. \"Today marks the beginning of a new era for Frontier—one with transparency in our prices, no change fees and the lowest total price,\" declared Barry Biffle, Frontier's CEO. The airline is doing that by creating three new ticket classes—Economy Bundle, Premium Bundle, and Business Bundle—to go along with Basic fares. Now, instead of charging customers à la carte fees for changes or cancellation on most tickets, Frontier will simply grant the right to cancel or change a flight without charge as long as you purchase tickets in one of the airline's three more expensive categories. Changing and canceling won't be free with a Basic ticket, the airline's cheapest fare. Thus, some cancellation and change fees will be eliminated at Frontier. Contrary to a lot of misleading headlines (even the Associated Press got it wrong in a widely disseminated headline), Frontier has not cut out these fees entirely.",

Mild winters and wet summers, like the ones experienced in many parts of the United States in recent years, tend to boost populations of the eight-legged bloodsuckers, experts told the Associated Press, and the tiny parasites have expanded their geographic range as well. Species once confined to New England and the Midwest have spread into the South and the Great Plains, while southern varietals have crept northward. A bite from one of the most common species, blacklegged ticks (aka deer ticks), can cause Lyme disease, an infection with symptoms such as a bull's-eye rash, fever, headache, and fatigue. The illness should be treated with antibiotics to avoid more serious neurological issues and heart problems. According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, Lyme disease is most commonly transmitted by ticks in the Northeast, upper Midwest, and northwestern states, but cases have been reported \"in nearly all states in the U.S. and in large areas in Europe and Asia.\" Lyme isn't the only tickborne disease out there, either. As you can see from the tick maps assembled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there's basically no spot in the contiguous United States that doesn't have at least one type of teeny-tiny tick that would like to make a meal of you or your dog and give one of you something unpleasant to go.",

We're all feeling it, especially at the grocery store and at the gas pump, even as the big companies in those industries rake in record or near-record profits. A new study compounds the growing accusations of corporate gouging with a finding that Lyft and Uber are paying many drivers less than the minimum wage where they live. The Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at the University of California, Berkeley, analyzed ride-share driver earnings from January 2022 in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, the San Francisco area, and Seattle. In all five metro areas, \"the typical passenger and delivery drivers earned less than the applicable minimum wage\" despite measures to avoid that. The study endeavored to calculate what drivers actually take home by adjusting for required expenses. It concluded that the hourly \"employee-equivalent pay—which adjusts drivers’ net pay for employer payroll taxes that drivers must pay and mandated employee benefits—equaled only $5.97 in California and $9.18 across the other metro areas.\" In the state of California, Proposition 22, a voter-supported law that's currently on the books, requires that gig passenger drivers and delivery app drivers be guaranteed a \"minimum of 120 percent of the relevant minimum wage\" before tips, according to the study. The study omitted gratuities from its core findings, although it did track what tips added to driver income—and the picture wasn't much prettier. \"Tips added about 20 percent to these amounts,\" the study found. Even with tips, pay for Uber and Lyft drivers is a far cry from the legal minimum wage in San Francisco ($18.07) and Los Angeles ($17.27), and that doesn't account for drivers' expenses required to maintain and fuel vehicles.",

A single selfish tourist taking a small vial of sand would barely seem to matter. Indeed, some previous generations of travelers grew up thinking there's no harm in snatching small amounts of beaches for sentiment's sake. But if everyone did that, eventually the damage would mount. Just as the unthinkably massive herds of American buffalo were gradually hunted to the brink of extinction, many of the world's beaches are under assault by extreme weather, dwindling local maintenance budgets, theft for industrial purposes (there's a black market for sand), and hordes of self-centered visitors. Destinations around the world are getting serious about banning the practice of taking sand, and many of them are backing up the rules with stiff fines and even the threat of prison time. You might think that beaches are simply deposits of naturally replenishing sand. But you'd be wrong. A not-insignificant number of popular beaches have in fact been engineered to look and feel the way they do. Even in Florida, which is world-famous for its shores, the natural substance lining significant sections of the coast is actually a boggy gray mud more suited to growing mangrove trees than to playing beach blanket bingo. In many popular tourist areas, the sugary powder we know and love is often the product of intentional civic engineering. Just this year, Fort Lauderdale spent $40 million and called in the Army Corps of Engineers to replenish its dwindling supply; in 2018, the price for new sand was $50 million.",

Among travelers interested in visiting Africa, some of the top safety concerns often cited include crime, political unrest, and the targeting of LGBTQ+ people. While it’s true that many places on the continent have struggled with those issues, it’s important to remember that Africa encompasses a huge number of countries and cultures, with a wide spectrum of safety levels depending on a bunch of different factors. As ever, it’s wise to stay informed about a given destination—and stay alert to its nuances—when you're planning international travel. A handy resource in that regard is the U.S. State Department’s directory of travel advisories assessing each country’s threat level on a scale of 1 (“Exercise normal precautions”) to 4 (“Do not travel”). At the moment, 10 nations in Africa have been given the U.S. government’s safest rating (level 1). Several popular tourism destinations such as South Africa and Morocco aren’t among them (those two countries are currently at level 2), though that doesn’t mean you should automatically scratch them off your bucket list. After all, France and Italy are at level 2 as well. But you should be aware that travelers do face, in the State Department's assessment, a heightened safety risk beyond the 10 places listed below. No matter where you’re headed, there are many precautions you can take to lower the dangers. The State Department has posted a helpful list of best safety practices on its website.",

No matter how they’re eaten—plain, dipped in coffee, slathered with jam or chocolate spread, stuffed with ham and melted cheese—croissants are an integral part of a French breakfast (or afternoon snack). You’ll know a croissant has been made the right way when it has a flaky outer case; light, buttery, yet squidgy innards; and the power to make your heart sing. The pastry is always made using either butter (croissants au beurre) or margarine (croissants ordinaires, which have a more breadlike texture). As you meander the quaint sidewalks of Paris, you’ll also notice bakeries selling variations like croissant aux amandes (topped with almond cream and sliced almonds), rectangular pain au chocolat (the same dough but filled with dark chocolate), and swirl-shaped pain aux raisins (layered with custard and raisins). More recent innovations have capitalized on a craze for fusion pastries such as the cronut (croissant + donut) and the cruffin (croissant + muffin). Then, of course, there’s the crookie, a hybrid combining a croissant with cookie dough that became a TikTok phenomenon in early 2024 at Maison Louvard (11 rue de Châteaudun, 9th arrond.). For the record, I found the crookie to be far too sweet. My 7-year-old, on the other hand, devoured the thing in 5 seconds flat. Chacun à son goût.

If you're planning to rent a car on a road trip in another country and you think you can simply use your mobile phone for step-by-step driving directions, think again. Technology can be wonderful, but modern corporations aren't. They work against current advances in roaming privileges by restricting your use of them when you travel. Waze and the mapping systems of major navigation apps work brilliantly—at home. And they work brilliantly abroad, too—if you live there. But once you take your phone away from your home county and use a foreign data network, the speed of your data access is likely to be too slow for your navigation app to keep up. Even if you have international roaming turned on, your mobile phone carrier probably throttles the speed at which you're allowed to download data when you're in other countries. Many traveling mobile phone customers get data at much slower rates than locals do. T-Mobile, for example, promises \"high-speed\" data, but the fine print reveals that in some places, that could be as slow as 256 Kbps, which is galacial by modern standards. You may think your phone carrier offers robust international plans that grant unlimited data and unlimited texts. But you'll usually find that those \"unlimited\" promises are still hogtied by molasses-slow data speeds. Your carrier probably doesn't trumpet the fact that its international speeds are drastically curtailed, so be sure to ask what they will be.",

Most summers, Orlando's theme parks construct a new blockbuster ride or two to attract families anew. But 2024 is different. A year from now, Orlando will open its first new theme park in 26 years, Universal Epic Universe. Construction crews are already testing rides at what is shaping up to be the most elaborate and cutting-edge theme park the United States has seen in decades. Ahead of that huge debut, Orlando is putting on a milder party than usual in 2024. You'll be hearing lots of hype about Orlando in the coming weeks through the usual advertising channels and on social media, but the truth is that this year's changes can best be described as rearranging the furniture. Pretty much every major new thing to do in Orlando is a reworking of an older attraction that needed fixing. • On June 28, Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom officially opens Tiana's Bayou Adventure, a top-to-bottom re-skinning of the popular but culturally problematic Splash Mountain water flume ride. The attraction will now center on the characters from the 2009 animated film The Princess and the Frog. Disney crews shut down the old ride in January 2023 to redecorate, rip out dozens of Audio-Animatronic robots, and install a much smaller number of more advanced replacements, like Tiana (pictured above). Until the ride begins hosting preview guests, the jury is out on whether the finished product will reflect the penny-pinching and quality drift typical of latter-day Disney executives, or whether the company's recent leadership woes and mass layoffs of creative teams have brought Disney's creative powers back to form.",

(Beleaguered residents of coastal communities from Miami Beach to Phuket might beg to differ.) Still, it's safe to assume the world's drinking laws won't be set aside due to lack of use anytime soon. Spain, in fact, seems to get stricter with its booze regulations every year. For a long time, the country's legal drinking age was 16. Starting in 1991, though, regional governments began raising the minimum drinking age to 18. The last regional holdout, Asturias in the country's northwest, joined the rest of Spain in 2015. Ever since, alcohol \"may not be sold, served or supplied to persons under the age of 18\" anywhere in Spain, according to Madrid's official tourism website. Obviously, that's a younger drinking age than the 21-years-old minimum that has been the law of the land in the United States since 1984. For 18-, 19-, and 20-year-old Americans headed to Spain and considering bucking Gen Z's sober-curious bent, we refer you to MIT's online advice for students participating in the university's study abroad program. \"Be mature,\" reads the guidance, written in the style of a stern vice principal trying to quiet down an unruly assembly. \"Don’t be the 'ugly American.'

Renting a car in Europe is subject to a slightly different set of default rules than renting in the U.S., so Americans have to be more alert during the rental process. This advice, which comes from experts at the American Automobile Association, SIXT car rental company, and recent experience, can smooth the road. • Be sure your driver’s license is valid in the countries where you plan to drive. While few countries actually require an International Driving Permit (IDP), many (including Spain, France, Hungary, and Italy) require official translations of your local license. An IDP is accepted in lieu of a language-specific translation, according to the U.S. State Department, provided you also have your state-issued driver’s license on hand. An IDP costs $20, is valid for a year, and can be obtained at most AAA offices (find one at www.aaa.com). You will need two passport-size photos, your driver’s license, and the signed application form, available for download here. You can also get one by mail, but AAA recommends calling ahead to verify that your local office handles driving permits. • Age matters. Some rental companies—and even some countries—have minimum and maximum age requirements or charge extra for drivers over a certain age. For instance, only drivers 21 and older can rent in Ireland and England, and vacationers under 25 will pay a surcharge in Spain.",

Looking at the photos side by side, it's clear someone slapped Diddy's face over Williams' ... an attempt to connect the VP to the disgraced rap mogul. This isn't the first time the photo of Harris and Montel has been used against the Vice President. Prior to this fake image, MAGA supporters pushed out the red carpet pic as evidence that Harris used celebrities for clout. Williams has defended his former girlfriend in the past. Back in 2019, when Harris first ran for the Oval Office, Williams took to X and confirmed he and the former senator \"briefly dated.\" . @KamalaHarris and I briefly dated about 20 years ago when we were both single.",

The couple found themselves feeling homesick for the scents of their Asian-American upbringing, but the candles at everyday retailers just weren’t cutting it.\n\n“We started off by burning whatever we could find off the shelves from department stores,” explains Luo. “And every time we did find a candle, it was always mixed with maybe a flower, or something like a vanilla or lavender base—something that didn’t really capture the authentic essence of the smells we were looking for and grew up with.”\n\nThus, Emme NYC was born.

Shari Redstone, who controls Paramount via her family holding National Amusements Inc. “ought to send a nice pot of flowers or chicken soup” as a token of appreciation, Diller joked.

During that time, I did not directly report on the subject nor use them as a source. “The relationship was never physical but should have been disclosed to prevent the appearance of a conflict,” she added. “I deeply regret not doing so immediately and apologize to those I’ve disappointed, especially my colleagues at New York.”\n\nHer statement came after NY Mag announced: “Recently our Washington Correspondent Olivia Nuzzi acknowledged to the magazine’s editors that she had engaged in a personal relationship with a former subject relevant to the 2024 campaign while she was reporting on the campaign, a violation of the magazine’s standards around conflicts of interest and disclosures.",

The former Paramount and Fox chief who now chairs IAC Corp. accused an array of top financial sector figures of embracing policies on Trump’s agenda even as they refuse to acknowledge Trump’s “rotten” character. “I want Donald Trump pushed into the dust heap of history,” Diller said Friday at the FT Business of Entertainment Summit.

But that kind of awards-season mojo has been shifting, however slowly, with the most recent Best Picture winners, Oppenheimer and Everything Everywhere All At Once, released July and March of their respective years. In fact, the big Oscar opponent and BAFTA winner to the latter title, All Quiet on the Western Front, also defied the odds, having first played at Berlin in late winter of 2022, around the same time Everything Everywhere debuted at SXSW. Cannes also has become a much bigger factor in recent years, launching such winners and contenders as Parasite, Once Upon a Time In Hollywood, Triangle of Sadness, Anatomy of a Fall, Drive My Car, The Zone f Interest and others that went on to Best Picture nominations. That goes against the previous common wisdom that Cannes was a risky place to start an Oscar run as May is so far away from the prime time to campaign. So in other words, everything everywhere is being turned on its head when it comes to all things Oscar. But there can be no question that the fall fests still offer a big platform, and that includes the New York and London festivals, starting on September 27 and October 9, respectively, which provide further boosts in Oscar voter-heavy places.

We've got the classics, like witches, vampires, and werewolves, plus plenty of others, like merfolk, fae, ghosts, zombies, necromancers, and so much more. These supernatural romance books bring a touch of magic to the romance world, and they're just a little bit different from a few similar genres.\n\nThe closest comparison would probably be fantasy romance, or \"romantasy,\" which usually brings in elements of the fantasy genre (epic scale, significant world-building, a complex system of magic) and layers those with a significant romance plot thread. For many readers, the line between these books and paranormal romance books for adults is somewhat blurry, but in most cases, the \"paranormal\" label indicates that you'll get a heavier focus on the supernatural beings — the vampires, the shifters, and so on — and on the romance, rather than the full-fledged fantasy world-building.\n\nNo matter your tastes, there's definitely a good paranormal romance book out there for you! Some authors prefer to put a rom-com twist on the genre, like Lana Harper or April Asher. Others, like Nalini Singh or Kresley Cole, are mainstays of the genre for their sprawling, long-running series filled with all sorts of sexy supernaturals. Whether you take your paranormal romance with a side of chills or a side of laughs, check out these books to add some magic to your reading.",

An industry where if I am using my hands too much on camera, the director shouts in all seriousness, \"Not so much of the ethnic hands!\" \"White hands, Chris, white hands,\" I whisper to myself while smiling. By the way — that is a true story. The essence of what I do is put myself in spaces where I must be chosen, where I must be selected as worthy enough to portray this thing. Beyond the ability to act, a large portion has to do with whether I am physically and aesthetically appealing, and pleasing enough to a certain gaze. When you make a living off your desirability, is the power of your body ever just yours? My body has been turned into an object of desire by whiteness, and as long as the main decision-makers and check signers in Hollywood are white bodies, then I must be desirable to and for them. This is why I always say that it is nice to receive fat checks (I have rent to pay), but nothing changes until I and people who look like me are signing them. In my opinion, this is the other side of the same coin of being seen as worthless. Because if I am not desirable in some way, then I am worthless.

Obviously, this was my friend, so I was being genuine in my language. However, as someone who has been a professional for many years, as well as an academic, the voice that I heard on playback was just one of many.

That's why it's refreshing to see that recently many Latine celebs have been more candid about the pressure they've felt to code-switch or \"talk white\" and are openly rejecting the practice to embrace their authentic selves. This is no doubt due to the current selling power Latines are enjoying on a global level.

Better known by her stage name, Elsa y Elmar, the Latin Grammy-nominated singer has been making waves in the music scene for more than a decade. But with her latest album \"PALACIO\" releasing on August 30th, and on the brink of hitting the road for her biggest tour yet, Carvajal is poised to reach a whole new level. To reach that level once meant putting in many years on the indie circuit and playing solo in bars trying to connect to people who had never heard of her. And even though her unknown indie artist days are behind her, the singer admits that the pressure remains. Carvajal says that pressure can be both good and bad. On the one hand it can push artists to achieve bigger and better things, reaching the levels previously reached by their idols. But on the other hand, the constant pressure to push for more and compare oneself to their peers or those who came before can be detrimental from a mental health perspective. The songstress says that she sometimes found herself in a constant state of work, thinking about what more she can do.

I was feeling homesick and needed to feel connected to my roots and my community. El Teteo serves as an extension of what I was taught: to find moments of joy through pain, troubles, and hard work. For me, community is about gathering with the people you love and care for, no matter where you are — whether that's getting together with beach chairs in front of a building or plastic chairs at a park under a bridge. Teteo, which is a Dominican slang word for partying and gathering anywhere, suggests that when it comes to community, all you need is good music, good company, and some beers — and, in some cases, food. It's all about sharing moments that aren't guaranteed tomorrow, and it's something that's very much embedded in Latine culture. As a New Yorker, I found myself missing my city and its vibrant club scenes and dance parties. At almost every party and club I'd been to in Los Angeles, people stood around with a drink in hand instead of getting on the dance floor.

I was in awe of her ability to capture and materialize people's need for expression through comedy. Her determination and contagious, guttural laugh drew me in, and we quickly bonded over our shared experiences and challenges as Dominican comedians. As comics, we spent hours discussing how difficult it was to gain support and recognition in an industry that often overlooks voices like ours. Our conversations sparked a vision: to create a dedicated platform that would elevate Dominican voices in comedy. When we started Morir Soñando, it was a venture born out of necessity and a deep love for our culture. I'd long felt comedy was missing something crucial — an authentic representation of Dominican voices. While the comedy scene is vibrant and diverse, Dominican comedians often lack a platform that celebrates our unique perspectives and experiences. This gap in representation motivated us to create a space where our stories could be told unapologetically. I sometimes joke about being emotionally constipated. What I mean by that is I don't know how to cry, but I do know how to make a joke about it. Laughter grounds the moment and transcends people's identity and status. It's the very thing that reminds us we are alive and present. Comedy is like feeding medicine with candy; it brings awareness to difficult topics with levity. And as a result, it often supports us with our mental health and through some of life's most challenging moments, including loss and trauma.

Perhaps most famously on the Latine side of things, El Gran Combo's \"Un Verano En Nueva York\" stands as an ode to New York City summer and everything it brings with it: street festivals, block parties, boat tours, beach days. And for many Latines in the city, summertime marks the return of a time-honored tradition: Latin dance nights. As a kid, my father had my sister and me on the weekends, and he would take us down to South Street Seaport for salsa night. This was before the recent renovation, back when the Fulton Fish Market still operated out of downtown and would fill the air with the strong scent of tilapia, salmon, and sea bass. But as you got closer to the water, the scent dissipated, and the rhythm of the clave got stronger. You'd pass Pizzeria Uno and the now-defunct bar Sequoia, turn a corner, and boom, a dance floor full of NYC's best steppers, the bass thick enough to swim through. These parties are an important part of maintaining the culture, language, and political power we've seen dwindle as rents have soared. Those Latin dance nights were a formative part of my childhood. Not because I learned how to dance there (I still haven't fully), but because of the experience of the community they provided, the enclave of Latinidad that enveloped you when you walked in.",

But in her latest movie, \"Trigger Warning,\" Alba not only returns to the screen; she also makes a rare appearance as a Latina lead of an action flick. In the movie, which was released on Netflix on June 21, Alba plays Parker, a US special forces commando stationed overseas who takes a trip back to her hometown after learning her father has died (which she later discovers was caused by a murder). The \"Dark Angel\" and \"Sin City\" actress, who also worked as the film's executive producer, says she made sure every detail behind her Mexican-American character was as authentic as possible. It's no secret that Latines are major moviegoers and yet remain underrepresented on-screen. According to UCLA's 2021 Hollywood Diversity Report, Latines accounted for only 5.4 percent of movie leads and 5.7 percent of actors in any onscreen role that year. When we dive into specific genres that many Latines enjoy — like horror, rom-coms, and action films — the representation is even lower. But Alba's return proves how much we need to see more of this. \"I feel a lot of the times when you see women in this genre; we're either the damsel in distress or we're the male version of a badass woman — pretty emotionless [with] pretty stoic one-liners, wearing completely impractical clothes in action,\" Alba says.",

The Venezuelan singer-songwriters are the sons of Latine pop icon Ricardo Montaner. However, the talent in the Montaner family doesn't end with Mau, Ricky, and Ricardo. Mau and Ricky's sister, Evaluna Montaner, and their brother-in-law, Camilo, are also impacting the industry. If you listen closely, the elder Evaluna and Camilo's voices can be heard on Mau y Ricky's new album \"Hotel Caracas,\" which also marked the brothers' return to Venezuela for the first time in over a decade. Family and community are core tenets for the duo. \"There's no hiding the obvious,\" Ricky Montaner says of his famous family. \"I'm proud as a family that we've been able to lift each other up, inspire each other, and connect with people in this way. It's beautiful and special.\" Growing up in Caracas, Mau and Ricky saw their father perform big-time hits like \"Tan Enamorados\" and \"Bésame\" to sold-out crowds. He would even bring them on stage to sing with him occasionally. Ricardo also once had a record label with Venezuelan brothers Servando & Florentino. They often rehearsed at home and showed the younger Montaner brothers that a sibling duo in Latin music was possible. Now, the sons are inviting their dad to sing their songs. In a hidden feature on the song \"Muriendo de Miedo,\" Ricardo's voice beautifully harmonizes with his sons'. \"It's full circle,\" Mau Montaner says.",

For Jay Wheeler, the connection he shares with his grandmother, Clara Luz, is something he cherishes. It has helped mold him into the man and artist he is today. \"One of the most beautiful treasures I have in my life is my abuela,\" Wheeler says. \"She's a person that loves to go out, who loves to party, and I'm lucky to still have her with me and have her healthy.\" But along with being the life of the party, his grandmother has helped instill many of the values that guide the singer — who's been hard at work ushering in a new brand of romantiqueo with his albums \"Emociones\" and \"Emociones 1.5.\" \"She taught me to be respectful, to always be empathetic to people, and to have a healthy fear of God. I'm a person who believes very strongly in God, thanks to her,\" the singer says, adding that she also taught him to \"just be loving with the world.\" That caring disposition is something that comes across in his music and his interactions with fans and the media. Wheeler once mentioned that he tries not to wear sunglasses because he wants his fans to be able to see his eyes.

Rauw Alejandro and Peso Pluma are set to take the stage at the 2024 Governor's Ball in NYC between June 7 and 9. While Becky G and J Balvin performed at the music festival in 2022 and 2021, respectively, this year marks the first time that two Latin music acts are headlining on separate days. And it's about time. Since the 1940s and '50s, when cha cha and mambo took the US by storm, the mass appeal of Latin music has been undeniable. With its mix of West African and Spanish rhythms, the music is inherently danceable, which no doubt has helped genres like salsa and reggaetón break down the language barrier. You don't need to know what Bad Bunny's saying to be able to move to the beat. And yet, for a long time, Latin and African artists could only be found at music festivals that catered to those demographics specifically. This is no longer the case, as major music festivals have recently started including more Latin acts in their lineups. In 2023, Bad Bunny became the first Spanish-language artist to headline Coachella, where Eladio Carrión and Anuel AA also appeared. That same year, iLe, PJ Sin Suela, and Los Rivera Destino performed at the SXSW Music Festival. In 2024, Coachella doubled down on the Latin acts, inviting both Peso Pluma and J. Balvin. And the trend doesn't seem to be stopping. But why has it taken so long for major festivals to get the message that our music is so fire?",

Despite her blockbuster hits, platinum-selling albums, sold-out tours, and a Las Vegas residency, the Latina megastar continues to be chastised about her romantic relationships. Front and center today is her marriage to Ben Affleck, with various opinions and rumors swirling on social media. But all the chatter points to one thing: blatant misogyny from internet trolls and the media that places the blame on Lopez for her failed relationships. From the divorce rumors to the cancellation of her tour, Lopez is being kicked while she's down, and the public seems thirsty for it. Today's headlines paint a one-sided picture of Affleck navigating a tumultuous marriage to an overly ambitious, workaholic diva who can't seem to get love right. These biased narratives seem to be one reason why Lopez released her film \"This Is Me…Now\" and its accompanying album by the same name, as well as the documentary that shows the behind-the-scenes of it all, \"The Greatest Love Story Never Told.\" Still, she can't seem to break through the noise, the trolling, and the harassment bestowed upon her. On June 5, Lopez addressed the situation to fans via her On The JLo newsletter, where she wrote: \"It may seem like there's a lot of negativity out in the world right now . . . but don't let the voices of a few drown out that there is soooo much love out there. Thank you, thank you, thank you!! I love you all so much.\"",

They had already performed at the venue two nights in a row, as well as played a show at Madison Square Garden on May 23. With an audience filled with mostly Dominicans — many of them proudly waving their flags — it was remarkable to see how a genre that was once associated with the bars and brothels of lower-income neighborhoods in the countryside of the Dominican Republic has become such a global phenomenon. And it was Aventura, a boy band formed by four Dominican teenagers in the 1990s, that would completely revolutionize bachata beyond what any of them could have originally envisioned. In February, Romeo Santos announced that he was reuniting with the group for the second time for the Cerrando Ciclos tour, which kicked off on May 1 in Sacramento, CA. The group had last joined forces in 2020, right before the Coronavirus pandemic hit for their Immortal Tour. According to Billboard, it grossed $25.8 million. And while Tuesday evening was far from their last tour performance in the tri-state area, the group really gave their all, exciting the crowd with some of their biggest hits: \"Dile al Amor,\" \"Un Beso,\" \"Todavía Me Amas,\" and their 2021 single with Bad Bunny, \"Volví.\" They closed the show with a guest appearance from Judy Santos for \"Obsesión.\" It took a while for bachata to become a global sensation, but today, even non-Latin music artists like The Weeknd are dipping their toes in the genre.",

But despite the naysayers, Lopez has never given up her spot as a rom-com star. The 2005 romantic comedy \"Monster-in-Law,\" which she stars in alongside Jane Fonda, followed those less desirable films and became one of her highest-grossing films to date . Jennifer Lopez's life and career have taken the world on an unforgettable roller-coaster ride. We've witnessed the ups, downs, and unexpected twists in between. She may not always be a favorite among critics , but Lopez has continued to produce films through her company Nuyorican Productions, elevating herself to celeb royalty. As she juggles the many crowns she wears, one that deserves the spotlight is her role in essentially being our first Latina rom-com queen. Lopez is to the 2000s what Meg Ryan is to the 1980s and '90s. Her comedic timing is always on point, and mixing it with her vulnerability has created a recipe for success in the rom-com genre. From 2001's \"The Wedding Planner,\" which grossed $94 million worldwide, to 2004's \"Shall We Dance?\" which brought in $170 million at the box office, and recent films like 2022's \"Marry Me,\" which racked up $50 million, Lopez has continued to solidify herself as a rom-com queen. Other Latina actors have dipped their toe in the genre and done well: think Salma Hayek in 1997's \"Fools Rush In\" alongside Matthew Perry, and Eva Mendes in 2005's \"Hitch\" alongside Will Smith.",

But humor was always around me, and I learned at a very young age the power of laughter. My grandmother was a very funny woman. She had this amazing ability to present heavy topics like poverty and even death in ways that were humorous. At first, I used to think it was insensitive, but I quickly learned that it was just a coping mechanism and a way to make things digestible because life was already hard enough.

Read the pieces here. There's a cultural maxim within Latinidad that's always left me a bit unsettled: \"Lo que pasa en casa se queda en casa.\" It means what happens at home stays at home — aka loyalty above everything. Growing up in a subjectively funny family taught me invaluable lessons about the power of humor and its role as a survival tool, especially during challenging times. In my Ecuadorian immigrant family, our main coping mechanism was finding solace in humor amid chaos. But there was always a boundary, an invisible line to how far we could share drawn by the \"lo que pasa en la casa\" mentality — the notion that certain things should never leave the confines of our home. It became clear to me early on that this mentality stemmed from a desire to maintain appearances, protect the family's reputation, and uphold the value of privacy. The \"lo que pasa en la casa\" mentality always felt like a type of silencing or secrecy that prohibited many of my tías, tíos, cousins, and older siblings from seeking out things like therapy. It was also an invisible shackle placed around my artistry before it began. Some may argue that \"lo que pasa en casa\" is all about \"privacy\" or \"protection,\" but it's a double-edged sword. There are situations where it's crucial (say, if someone in the family wins the lottery and you don't want everyone coming out of the woodwork for a piece of the pie).",

Read the pieces here. Fabrizio Copano, a rising star in the world of stand-up comedy, isn't your typical Latine comic. His journey, shaped by his Chilean upbringing under a pos-dictatorship and his subsequent disillusionment with the American Dream, fuels a unique comedic perspective that tackles serious political and cultural themes. Copano's early life in Chile was marked by the tail-end of political turmoil. Growing up, he witnessed firsthand the harsh repercussions of Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship, a period characterized by repression, human rights abuses, and a stifling political climate. This experience undoubtedly contrasts the idealized image of the US he received through the media. \"Chile is very Americanized in certain ways, and we look up [to] the US,\" Copano says. \"The culture shock was when I figured out that we are ahead of the US in so many ways because we have already lived through many of the traumas that the US is just now confronting.\" When Copano realized America is \"just as messy,\" it allowed him to view Americans from a more humanistic lens. \"The system isn't as perfect as it pretends to be. I now use this idea in my stand-up, that we're ahead of the US — we are from the future,\" Copano says. Indeed, Copano uses comedy to explore the disillusionment that sets in when the romanticized American dream confronts America's often harsh realities.",

Read the pieces here. One of the things I love about comedy is how it fuses my personality with my purpose. I was diagnosed with depression when I was 14 years old, a time when I began comparing my life to that of my high school peers and quickly noticed the differences. At the time, most of my peers had never experienced significant loss like I had. While they were preoccupied with clothes, gossip, and pop culture, I was grappling with thoughts of death. This numbness to ordinary concerns led me into a deep existential crisis. My struggle with depression was triggered early on by the loss of several family members, including my mother and my grandmother. Processing these losses took years of therapy. Working as a comedian has allowed me to piece together memories like a puzzle to grasp my life's bigger picture. Every time I unravel the layers of my experiences, I discover the humor embedded within them. As a young girl, I didn't know that my biological mother had passed away; I was told to call my grandmother Mama. Although there was a photograph of another woman on the mantle who resembled me, my grandmother would deflect the question whenever I inquired about her. She was a master at making me feel valued and special and was always ready to listen to me chatter, calling me her little Cotorra. I'm not sure if I had a natural sense of humor, but my grandmother certainly saw a big personality in me and nurtured it.",

In July of 2024, the company broke two major Nielsen records — becoming the first streaming platform to top the Media Distributor Gauge chart, which measures TV usage by media company; and becoming the first streamer to exceed 10% of total TV usage in a single month. This move to the living room is one that CEO Neal Mohan takes seriously. “As you know, the environment in the living room is incredibly dynamic. In fact, in my career, I haven’t seen it ever to be as dynamic as it is today,” Mohan said during the 2024 Made on YouTube event in New York City. “We recognize that we have a really important role in that environment. Audiences increasingly, especially young audiences, when they turn on the TV, they’re turning on YouTube. That really is their experience in the living room.”\n\nBack in February, Mohan wrote in a blog post that he sees the living room as the “next frontier” for YouTube. The company has taken major steps to expand its role in this space, from broadcasting events like Coachella to partnerships like the NFL Sunday Ticket, which is now in its second season on the platform. During the event, Mohan also revealed that creator earnings that come from living room viewing have grown 30%, year over year. In an effort to keep expanding this frontier, YouTube announced it will be dividing its creators channels into seasons and episodes, a model that emulates other streaming services.

TV comedy writer, columnist and author Joel Stein makes the case that, while Curb may be a comedy of manners, it’s also the first sitcom about an asshole. By Joel Stein\n\nArtwork by André Carrilho\n\nLarry David by André Carrilho\n\nThe theory I am about to espouse about Curb Your Enthusiasm is wrong. I ran it by executive producer Jeff Schaffer, and he said that never entered his or Larry David’s mind. But it’s also true. There are two reasons Curb was groundbreaking. The first Schaffer agrees with, so I’ll start there. Curb launched just two years after the end of Seinfeld, in which David reinvigorated the sitcom by stripping it down to its comedic bones via his rule of “no hugging and no learning.” Post-Seinfeld, the sitcom powered on for a bit with shows like Friends, Spin City and Suddenly Susan, but it was again in need of reinvention. Curb did that by throwing out the script. Literally. Actors received a detailed outline and improvised all of their lines. David completely jettisoned the practice of staying in the writers’ room until 2 a.m. to beat a joke. This innovation forced the situations in situation comedy—not just the jokes—to be funny. It also made the show feel alive. “Even the audition was fun,” says my friend John Ross Bowie, who appeared in a 2009 episode with his wife, Jamie Denbo. “You don’t need to get off book.",

Ian Brennan partnered with the mega-producer once more to bring the Menendez brothers’ story to screen, from their traumatic upbringing to the notorious night they murdered their parents, José and Kitty Menendez. The limited series seeks to discover who the real monsters in the high-profile murder trial were. The Menendez brothers captivated America, as their televised Court TV trial is one of the first of its kind. The two boys killed their parents on Aug. 20, 1989, at only 18 and 21 years old. Their counsel called it self defense, but both were convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole after two trials.

I don’t want a contested election, in any way,” Diller said.\n\nHis comments came during FT’s Business of Entertainment Summit in West Hollywood, Calif.\n\nDiller, whose media conglomerate includes outlets like People Magazine and The Daily Beast, said he wants the race to be a blowout for Harris, because it would symbolize a “repudiation” of Trump.\n\n“I think that would be extraordinarily healthy [for America],” Diller added.\n\nHe then ripped “plutocrats” who vote based solely on policies, and “refuse to talk about the character” of the candidates.\n\nDiller’s comments come less than a week after the second person in three months attempted to assassinate the former president at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. Trump later went on Greg Gutfeld’s show this week, where he quipped “I always said golf was a very dangerous game.”\n\nOn Thursday night, Oprah Winfrey hosted a town hall in support of Harris that included cameos from celebrities like Chris Rock, Ben Stiller, and Meryl Streep.\n\nDiller’s support for Harris comes after he said he would no longer support President Joe Biden’s reelection earlier this summer.",

The artist (a.k.a. Justin Vernon) just announced an extremely welcome three-song EP called SABLE,—his first new music under the Bon Iver name since 2019’s i,i. The new tracks “serve as a reset and reintroduction,” Vernon said in a press release, noting that he was “stripping the project down to the primary elements on which it was originally founded.” You can hear that directive in his delicate, meditative new track “S P E Y S I D E,” which sees the artist return after so many years to the sound he pioneered over a decade ago in songs like “Blood Bank” and “Re: Stacks.”\n\n“Emerging from a slow-burning breakdown—possibly done with music, thinking increasingly about the process of healing—SABLE, is a space for Vernon to unpack the darkness, pressure and anxiety that amounted to one of the most trying periods of his life,” the press release continues. You can hear that raw emotion all over the lyrics of the new song, as well as the album’s title, which was “named for near-blackness” itself. “I know now that I can’t make good/I wish I could,” Vernon sings at the beginning of the track, with only his acoustic guitar for company. Later, he closes with, “But maybe you can still make a man from me/here on Speyside quay/with what’s left of me/as you live and breathe/I really know now what had hold on me.”\n\nWith his autumn-themed album i,i, Vernon finished the seasons cycle he began in 2007 with For Emma, Forever Ago (winter) and continued through 2011 with Bon Iver, Bon Iver (spring) and 2016 with 22, A Million (summer).",

Today, as part of its Geeked Week festivities, Netflix released the first teaser for the second season of Hwang Dong-hyuk’s blisteringly dark satire of capitalism, as viewed through the lens of lethal games of tug-of-war, marbles, or other largely arbitrary children’s pasttimes.\n\n﻿\n\nThe teaser goes by very quickly, avoiding showing anything but the quickest glimpses of the games, their organizers and their PlayStation button masks, and the new, brightly colored playing grounds. It does, though, include the return of Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae, who became the first actor to win a Best Actor Emmy for a non-English-speaking role for his work on the show’s first season) still on the hunt for the organizers of the mysterious games, and, most importantly, confirms once and for all that he did not stick with his bizarre Ronald McDonald look from the end of the show’s first season.\n\nSquid Game returns to Netflix on December 26; its third and final season is slated to appear some time in 2025.",

What is it about Colin Farrell’s Oz Cobb (not Cobblepott, the character having been stripped of half of his usual name, alongside his historical attachments to generational power or wealth, in the transition to TV) that’s worth spending eight hours with? Those hoping to find the answer in the pages of the comics the show is ostensibly based on will likely come away scratching their heads. Set in the same rust-dusted version of Gotham City as Matt Reeves’ 2022 reboot project The Batman—a comic-book movie already so “grounded” as to be borderline subterranean—showrunner Lauren LeFranc’s show couldn’t be less interested in trick umbrellas, capes, or cinematic action of any but the most brutal and utilitarian varieties. Change the building signs, strip out a few references to “Arkham” and the Riddler’s late-film attack on the city, and this pilot could be from any of a dozen shows about a mid-tier criminal with delusions of upper-tier success anywhere in America. Which leaves us with Oswald Cobb himself, and Farrell’s efforts to take this character—a loose collection of crime-guy tropes, prosthetics, and quirks energized by The Batman‘s only truly fun performance—and build a workable TV protagonist out of him. Step one is to lessen him, the better for both threats and upward mobility: The Penguin from the film was comfortable playing king of the castle, albeit one beholden to the boss (Jon Turturro); here, the show makes it clear that Cobb is middle-management at best, serving at the whims of the nigh-aristocratic Falcone crime family.",

Mostly, that’s because a show’s never going to go too far wrong depicting the majority of politicians as self-serving near-sociopaths, but it certainly helped when the 2024 election suddenly pivoted, paving the way for Vice President Kamala Harris to achieve a Selina Meyer-esque ascendancy to the Oval Office. (If hopefully not a Selina Meyer-esque presidency to follow suit.) Now, the cast of the HBO show is getting back together for a fundraiser table read of the episode where Julia Louis-Dreyfus’ character learns she’s going to be president—despite the best interests of the people around her, the nation, and, more often than not, herself—in support of Democratic candidates. It’s going to be a pretty star-studded affair, too: Pretty much the entire cast of the series will be on hand, including Louis-Dreyfus, Tony Hale, Anna Chlumsky, Reid Scott, Matt Walsh, Timothy Simons, Gary Cole, Sam Richardson, Sarah Sutherland, Clea DuVall, and Sufe Bradshaw. Oh, and Stephen Colbert will be there, too, to moderate, because why the hell not jam a little more satirical weight in there somehow?

But there has, admittedly, been some pretty interesting stuff rolled out by host Joe Manganiello and the various streaming stars forced to endure this spectacle—sorry, we’re still recovering from watching The Sandman‘s Kirby Howell-Baptiste play third-grade party games for an extended period of appropriately Endless stage time—even if, in some cases, the interesting part isn’t necessarily what Netflix wants us focused on. ﻿\n\nLike, say, counting the number of times the words “Neil” or “Gaiman” appear in this new behind-the-scenes featurette for the second season of The Sandman, i.e., absolutely zero. The featurette itself is cool enough—we get shots of the big banquet of the gods scene from Season Of Mists, and shots of all the members of the Endless coming together for the first time in the show’s history. But you can also palpably feel the gaps where mentions of Gaiman’s “genius”—or even an appearance from the man himself—would normally go in a promo like this, presumably sucked into the void by the sexual assault allegations against the prominent author. Sandman is a big enough deal for Netflix that it’s unlikely to go the way of Dead Boy Detectives (which was canceled last month) any time in the immediate future, but it’s clear the streamer is feeling a little leery about how tightly it’s tied its brand to Gaiman’s in the lead-up to the show.",

This is a man who, 25 years after the fact, hired actors and scientists to try to prove that Leonardo DiCaprio’s ass would have drowned at the end of Titanic, no matter what your irritating friends on the internet say about how much room was on that goddamn floating door. This is not a man who lacks in pettiness, or the resources to fulfill it. As a minor example, take an excerpt from an interview Cameron recently gave to Empire, timed to the 40th anniversary of his breakout hit, The Terminator. When asked about whether he still likes the original movie four decades later, Cameron appears to walk himself down the following little road, and it’s a real lesson in the ways the mind can run when you’re sufficiently irritated about something for a sufficiently long time; while acknowledging he wishes the film had better production values, Cameron notes “I don’t cringe on any of the dialogue, but I have a lower cringe factor than, apparently, a lot of people do around the dialogue that I write… You know what? Let me see your three-out-of-the-four-highest-grossing films — then we’ll talk about dialogue effectiveness.”\n\nAgain: Nobody appears to have brought up Cameron’s dialogue, except for him.",

As reported by 404 Media and Tech Crunch, LinkedIn has come under criticism this week, not just because the basic practice of using user data to train its algorithm, which it’s been doing for the past year or two, is gross—it is, but in a “Ugh, everybody’s doing it lately” kind of way—but because the Microsoft-owned service didn’t update its terms of use to let users know about it, or how to opt out. We highlight “U.S. users” in the above paragraph because our privacy protections are crappier than a lot of other countries: Users in the EU, for instance, don’t have to worry about this stuff.

One solution is to simply improve the theatrical experience, with cleaner facilities and upgraded technology. Another solution is to make movie theaters more like Dave & Busters. There are no bad ideas in brainstorming! This comes from Variety, which reports that the eight biggest theater chains in the U.S. and Canada (AMC Entertainment Inc., Regal Cinemas, Cinemark USA, Inc., Cineplex, Marcus Theatres Corp., B&B Theatres, Harkins Theatres, and Santikos Entertainment) are investing more than $2.2 billion to modernize and upgrade more than 21,000 screens over the next three years. Michael O’Leary, president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners (NATO), tells the outlet that the upgrades are focused on cleanliness, comfort, and quality. Specifically, expected improvements include “laser projection technology, immersive sound systems, more comfortable seating, state-of-the-art air conditioning, lighting, signage and carpeting.”\n\nSome of the money, however, will reportedly go towards upgrading multiplexes into all-out entertainment complexes. Some theaters are looking to add “pickleball courts, ziplines, arcades, bowling alleys and more attractions” in addition to introducing more dining and beverage options.

In March, Netflix revealed that the sci-fi show was doing a follow-up to its popular (and horrifying) season four Star Trek riff, “USS Callister,” writing in a press release, “USS Callister will return… Robert Daly is dead, but for the crew of the USS Callister, their problems are just beginning.” Now, the series has confirmed that Cristin Milioti and Jimmi Simpson, who starred in the original episode as sentient beings trapped in a Trek-themed open-world game, are returning for the sequel. It seems like Michaela Coel and Jesse Plemons won’t be making a return trip. That makes sense for Plemons, since his character died in space, but maybe Coel’s actually made it out.

HBO’s latest critical darling has been renewed for a fourth season. The drama, which centers around the young employees of a prestigious London investment bank, has steadily increased its audience over the course of its run, “pacing nearly 40% ahead of season two with an average of 1.6M viewers per episode,” according to a network press release. With that in mind, it’s no wonder that HBO would invest—no pun intended—in the show and its stars, which includes Myha’la, Marisa Abela, Harry Lawtey, Ken Leung, and more. Industry benefited from a steady build of momentum since its premiere in 2020. With the conclusion of major HBO players like Succession and Barry, this year the series was able to move into the coveted Sunday night time slot and enjoy increased attention on what many fans and critics call its best season yet. In his recap for The A.V. Club, Manuel Betancourt compared the latest episode to a “modern masterpiece from the golden era of Peak TV,” Mad Men. “That was a show where workplace relationships helped comment and color the culture around them—and for anyone who’s seen ‘Guy Walks Into An Advertising Agency,’ you know that AMC show could go to bold and bloodied places you’d never have imagined possible,” he wrote, adding that Industry‘s “Nikki Beach, Or: So Many Ways to Lose” “may well rank alongside that Mad Men classic.”\n\nIn a statement, the series’ co-creators Mickey Down and Konrad Kay said of the renewal, “We are beyond thrilled and grateful to HBO, the incredible team at Bad Wolf and our phenomenal cast and crew for their continued belief in Industry and for allowing us to grow as creators, writers and now directors whilst taking the show to new heights.",

For this writer, it wasn’t quite loathing, but more of a resigned frustration that yet another exciting adaptation had fallen into the trap of making two half-movies instead of one good one. Hadn’t we learned from Deathly Hallows or Mockingjay? What about the three-part The Hobbit fiasco? Sure, that last one might be asking a little too much. Peter Jackson didn’t even learn from his own mistakes, and is absurdly splitting Andy Serkis’ upcoming Lord Of The Rings prequel, The Hunt For Gollum, into two parts. But Chu is insisting that he’s not that girl and knows everyone hates a “Part One.” In fact, he chose to leave the qualifier out of Wicked‘s title altogether. “This isn’t half the homework,” he explained to Entertainment Weekly of his decision. “If we were going to split it into two, we need to make sure that movie one is emotionally satisfying and by the end, you feel like that was a f—ing movie. [sic] I don’t like movies where you leave and feel like, ‘Well, I’ve got to wait for the next one.’ This should leave you with the highest of highs and so connected to these women.”\n\nOver the past few months, longtime fans have expressed a bit of confusion over the fact that the entirety of the Wicked stage show clocks in under three hours, which means Chu and his team are going to have to pad a lot to get two full blockbusters out of it.",

Earlier this week, he was featured as a supporting player in The New Yorker‘s profile of Bowen Yang, as the two were both hired as featured players on Saturday Night Live at the same time. But Gillis was fired almost immediately after critics resurfaced offensive jokes, including the use of slurs against Asian people. Now we’re getting the same story from SNL boss Lorne Michaels’ perspective in a new interview from The Hollywood Reporter. Asked if he’s more concerned about being politically correct now than when the show started in 1975, Michaels reflected on The Shane Gillis Incident as an example. “We had a bad time when I added Shane Gillis to the cast [in 2019]. He got beat up for things that he’d done years earlier [racist and homophobic jokes] and the overreaction to it was so stunning — and the velocity of it was 200 Asian companies were going to boycott the show,” Michaels recalled. “It became a scandal and I go, ‘No, no, he’s just starting and he’s really funny and you don’t know how we’re going to use him.

In fact, speaking at the Fast Company Innovation Festival, Sarandos challenged other streamers to follow suit, saying he is “hoping that the other folks in the business will follow” Netflix’s example (via Deadline). On Thursday, the company backed up Sarandos’ boasting with the release of its “What We Watched” report for the first half of 2024. The major takeaway from the report is that Netflix is experiencing its own British invasion. The top four series (and five of the top 10 overall) are U.K. productions.

Rounding out the top 10 series are Avatar: The Last Airbender (71.1 million views) at number five, Griselda (69.2 million) at number six, American Nightmare (55 million) at number seven, 3 Body Problem (52.4 million) at number eight, Berlin (48.5 million) at number nine, and One Day (39.4 million) at number 10.",

When Bob Dylan first toured with The Band in 1966, they were met with critical scorn and consumer agitation as the Minnesota singer-songwriter took his shocking concept of going electric at the Newport Folk Festival the year before to an entirely new level. Across three continents, the group was met with heckles and walk-outs from fans as their plugged-in swagger was deemed heretical by loyalists to Bob’s original folkways. The next eight years saw Dylan recede from the spotlight of touring life, opting to give up the road in favor of raising his family and recording such exploratory studio classics as John Wesley Harding, Nashville Skyline, Self Portrait, New Morning and the soundtrack to Sam Peckinpah’s Pat Garrett And Billy The Kid. But then, in 1973, David Geffen lured Bob away from his longtime home at Columbia Records to his Asylum imprint and, with the help of legendary concert promoter Bill Graham, convinced the Bard to reunite with his boys in The Band for a new album and North American tour. The resulting title, 1974’s Planet Waves, was a deep look into Dylan’s personal life and something of a sentimental journey honoring his marriage to Sara Lownds, a union that would begin to disintegrate a year later and chronicled on his 1975 masterpiece Blood On The Tracks.

The film’s first trailer is full of it. Saoirse Ronan’s character Rita sends her nine-year-old son George (Elliott Heffernan) away to hopeful safety when the bombs of Germany’s infamous Blitzkrieg begin to fall on London. Later, she must chase him down herself when she’s told he didn’t arrive at his intended destination. Sometimes they’re dancing or screaming from train beds, but people are always moving in the clip shared today by Apple TV+. ﻿\n\nWhen he’s sent away, George doesn’t find a wardrobe or magical land like his fellow evacuees in Narnia. (We’ll see frequent Ronan collaborator Greta Gerwig’s take on the era soon.) Instead, he embarks on a dangerous journey to return home to his mother and grandfather (Paul Weller), putting him in “immense peril” in the process. This doesn’t mean the journey is totally devoid of magic, however. In an interview with Deadline, McQueen called Blitz a “very dark” fairy tale. It’s “the Brothers Grimm. And that’s the journey that George goes on.”\n\nBlitz is also “a movie about Londoners,” the director shared when it was announced that the film would open the London Film Festival. “It honors the spirit of what and how Londoners endured during the blitz, but also explores the true representation of people in London, while at its core is the story of a working-class family desperate to be reunited during times of war.”\n\nThe film boasts a suitably epic score from Hans Zimmer (who previously worked with McQueen on 12 Years A Slave) and stars ​​Harris Dickinson, Benjamin Clementine, Kathy Burke, Stephen Graham, Leigh Gill, Mica Ricketts, CJ Beckford, Alex Jennings, Joshua McGuire, Hayley Squires, Erin Kellyman, and Sally Messham.",

Club, but we found just the right book to relaunch the format: The Third Gilmore Girl by Kelly Bishop, which debuted September 17 via Simon & Schuster. In her memoir, Bishop recounts her life in the entertainment industry, from her turbulent childhood to her start as a dancer in Radio City Music Hall’s Corps de Ballet to her Tony-winning performance in the original cast of A Chorus Line on Broadway, to her role as the sophisticated matriarch of the Gilmore family. She also reveals intimate details of her personal life, including the ups and downs of her relationships with family, friends, and lovers. After reading The Third Gilmore Girl, A.V. Club staffers Mary Kate Carr and Cindy White got together for a very book club-style conversation about the book and what they learned from it. We’ll look for your thoughts in the comments section. Were you a fan of Kelly Bishop before reading the book? How much did you know about her going in? MKC: Like many millennials I know Kelly Bishop best from Gilmore Girls—I’ve seen it a few times through and used to watch it with my little sister, so it’s got a special place in my heart. I’ve also obviously seen Dirty Dancing. And I knew she became famous as a Broadway star, I was vaguely aware she had a Tony, but I had no idea until reading the breadth of her stage career.",

After a photo from Glastonbury that seemed to show Gaga with a bulge in her underwear went viral in 2009, the pop star spent multiple years fending off questions as to whether or not she had a penis in interviews. (Gaga says the original photo was doctored.) In a now-legendary clip from 60 Minutes, Anderson Cooper asked the question and Gaga responded, “Maybe I do? Would it be so terrible?… Why the hell am I going to waste my time and give a press release about whether or not I have a penis? My fans don’t care and neither do I.”\n\nGaga just re-addressed why she never sent that press release in an appearance on Netflix’s What’s Next? The Future With Bill Gates. “When I was in my early 20s there was a rumor that I was a man,” she said, via The Independent. “I went all over the world. I traveled for tours and for promoting my records and almost every interview I sat in… they were like, ‘There’s rumors that you’re a man. What do you have to say about that?

Her asking, “You don’t remember my name?” was a pointed insult at the Rings Of Power faithful, who were more than willing to learn her name had anyone introduced us! Celebrimbor and Mirdania’s (Amelia Kenworthy) discombobulation is a symptom of the upheaval traveling throughout Middle-earth. Everyone, even those who supposedly know Sauron best and who have killed him before, is missing the forest for the trees. The path may be split in two, but most choose to walk into Sauron’s trap. For now, the problem is generational. Savvy Sauron dug his claws into party elders—your King Durins, your Lord Celembrimbors, your Ar-Pharazôns. They’re fools to do his dirty work (oh yeah), and it’s going over gangbusters with the Dark Lord. Whether it’s the endless pursuit of gold or feeding your political opponents to a giant cephalopod known as the Sea-worm, these rulers weaponize their standing to fit Sauron’s needs. And it’s not just the Valar’s creations turning on their leaders. In our mid-season check-in with Arondir, we overhear two Orcs—apologies, two Uruk—complaining about Adar, whom they characterize as chasing ghosts (presumably Sauron). Even among the Orcs, Middle-earth’s current leadership is overstaying its welcome. Unfortunately, like so many septuagenarian politicians, King Durin refuses to retire, and like so many children of septuagenarians, Prince Durin can’t convince him to hang up the crown.",

Set to the tune of The Hollies’ “The Air That I Breathe,” the trailer is largely focused on praise the film picked up during its recent showing at the Toronto International Film Festival, much of it focused on Grant, who plays (according to this trailer, leastways) a man in glasses who likes to hum a lot.

The result, pleasant enough but frustratingly bland, exists in a soupy, ill-defined emotional middle ground—occasionally amusing but not quite funny, and unable (or unwilling) to substantively commit to thoughtful, penetrating melancholia. Written and directed by Bernardo Britto, the Florida-set Omni Loop centers on Zoya Lowe (Mary-Louise Parker), a theoretical physicist who, along with her husband Donald (Carlos Jacott), has written a series of academic textbooks. Diagnosed with a black hole in between her lungs, Zoya is given a week to live, and sent home to spend that time with her small family, which includes daughter Jayne (Hannah Pearl Utt). When her nose starts to bleed during an early birthday celebration, Zoya excuses herself, slips into the bathroom and pops a regenerating pill from a bottle in her medicine cabinet, which takes her back to the hospital five days earlier. This reaction isn’t a magical, one-off fluke of some prescription medication, though; it spoils nothing (since the movie actually opens with 12-year-old Zoya finding a pill bottle) to note that she has had this ability her entire adult life. In conflict with the terminal nature of her diagnosis, Zoya crosses paths with Paula (Ayo Edebiri), a student at a local university. Needing both lab access as well as a sounding board, Zoya recruits Paula to help attempt to unravel the chemical composition of the pills, perhaps then allowing her to stave off death.",

Now, with an Army Of The Dead sequel also planned, comes another Netflix project from Snyder—and it might be his best for the streamer yet. The adult-animated series Twilight Of The Gods (which Snyder co-created with Eric Carrasco and Jay Oliva) follows the warrior Sigrid (Sylvia Hoeks) and the mortal Leif (Stuart Martin), who meet on the battlefield after Sigrid saves his life. We follow them as they fall in love and eventually plan to get married. On their wedding night, a beam of light crashes down from the sky, with Thor (Pilou Asbæk) coming behind it. Searching for his brother Loki (Paterson Davis Joseph), this mightier and more sinister interpretation of the god of thunder attacks Sigrid’s home, wreaking havoc on her village and its people and leaving Sigrid and Leif to devise a war in the name of those who’ve died, no matter the cost. They are joined in this pursuit by a group of outcasts whose dedication and lust for battle just may be enough to kill a god: The ax wielding Hervor (Birgitte Hjort Sørensen), poet Egill (Rahul Kohli), sorceress The Seid-Kona (Jamie Clayton), her servant Ulfr (Peter Stormare), and dwarf Andvari (Kristofer Hivju) make for one hell of a cast of characters, and the series gives them all time to shine. While their initial reasons for joining Sigrid and Leif’s dangerous quest may have been rooted in self-interest—be it a thirst for glory, a desire for revenge, or the promise of riches—the shared trials and tribulations they face forge an unbreakable bond between them.",

The show it spun off from, WandaVision, was a loving homage to television sitcoms, with each episode based on a different decade of American TV. The gimmick worked, for the most part, not just because of its cleverness, but because of the writers’ clear respect for and understanding of the history of television. Because of its unique setup, Marvel did a big pre-release push that laid out the basic conceit of the show, specifically highlighting the different decades and intentional callbacks. Viewers knew what they were getting into with WandaVision, even if they didn’t understand the metatextual purpose of the homages at the start of the series. With Agatha All Along, the messaging hasn’t been nearly as clear. Actor Joe Locke told Total Film that “every episode has a different classic horror/thriller film that it is basing itself off,” but the phrasing of that is ambiguous, and it’s not a point that Marvel has pushed particularly hard. Still, there was always a chance that Agatha would try to mimic WandaVision stylistically. The setup, after all, was kind of perfect for a re-do. Each of WandaVision’s nine episodes digs a little deeper into what, exactly, is going on. Eventually, we learn that after the death of her partner, Vision (Paul Bettany), Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) created an illusion around the town of Westview, New Jersey, trapping all the residents in a collective delusion, one marked by the tropes of the sitcoms Wanda took comfort in as a child.",

In a press release issued by the video game giant, Nintendo announced that it had, “together with The Pokémon Company, filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the Tokyo District Court against Pocketpair, Inc.” (The Pokémon Company, which controls licensing, publishing, and brand management for the massive gaming brand, is co-owned by Nintendo, Creatures, Inc., and Game Freak, the studio that actually makes most of the Pokémon games.) The tersely worded press release asserts that the “lawsuit seeks an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages on the grounds that Palworld, a game developed and released by the Defendant, infringes multiple patent rights.”\n\nAnd, to be fair, a lot of people have been waiting for this particular brightly colored cartoon shoe to drop for a while: Palworld was a massive smash hit when it released back in early 2024, selling more than 8 million copies within its first week of release, and logging more than 2 million concurrent users on Steam. (Note to non-gamers: That is a shit-ton, especially for a game from an unknown studio releasing their game into Early Access.) It also garnered a lot of accusations that its various cheerful monsters—who players can arm with guns, work to death in an environment that cheerfully boasts “no labor laws,” and then hack up and eat, all gleefully subverting the Pokémon formula—were blatantly copied from the Nintendo franchise, on account of people having eyes, and thus being able to look at them and instantly say “Gosh, that sure looks a lot like a Pokémon.”\n\nPocketpair representatives and developers, though, have always claimed that they were merely inspired by the older series, and that their game had cleared legal review with its designs.",

Releasing in theaters in February, and then sticking around for more than two months (to say nothing of its various recuts and re-releases), the film made more than $600 million at the box office, quickly becoming the most successful R-rated movie of all time. (A title it only lost this past summer, as Deadpool & Wolverine found at least one way they were, in fact, bigger than Jesus.) And now, it’s apparently coming back. This is per Consequence, reporting on a piece printed in Italpress, which states that Gibson is reportedly in Malta at the moment, holding conversations with Maltese authorities about using the island nation as a filming location for a new movie: The Passion Of The Christ: Resurrection, with an eye toward beginning filming in 2025. Neither Gibson, nor star Jim Caviezel, who’s set to return for the sequel, have been shy about their ambitions to get The Passion Of The Christ 2 made. Gibson initially announced the project back in 2016, and Caviezel made his own enthusiasm for the return clear in 2018, saying he expected the movie to be “The biggest film in history.” Gibson even gave a glimpse at plot details in 2022, when he suggested that his script for the movie was less grounded than the first film, which got a lot of its appeal from being a straightforward—if brutally violent—depiction of the story of Christ.",

Starring Krysten Ritter as a young woman with amnesia in 2052, and Keeley Hawes as the adult version of the child of one of Tatiana Maslany’s multiple characters on the original series, the show will now end after a single season.\n\nAiring this past summer in the United States (after getting blorped down as a big blob of single-serving clone goo on Australian streaming service Stan the previous November), Echoes failed to catch the same fire as the original Orphan Black, which combined Maslany’s riveting multi-part performance with pulpy questions about the role science plays in an increasingly dystopian world, as well as a “fuck it,” go for broke approach to its plotting. Despite Ritter’s best efforts, and its own intriguing hook—clones grown from vats are so old-school; now we do “print-outs” who arrive instantly at whatever age you want them to be—the sequel show couldn’t match the original’s energy. (Or, to quote our own Saloni Gajjar, “Its biggest achievement is reminding audiences that Orphan Black was a truly great ride.”)\n\nAMC appears to have agreed, pulling the plug on the series, which was developed for TV by showrunner Anna Fishko.

Not content to settle into his “unlikable paleontologist” niche, Schwimmer has done a lot of different projects in the years since the show went off the air, pulling in critical acclaim for work like his portrayal of Robert Kardashian in The People Vs.

Asked if he turned down the lead role in MIB due to scheduling conflicts with Friends, Schwimmer clarified that, no, the movie had been aimed directly at a gap in filming for the NBC mega-hit.

Sure, Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga recorded songs and learned choreography for it, but it’s really because it’s an edgy film in which the Joker “[doesn’t have] the words to say what he wants to say, so he sings them instead.” Lady Gaga even said she had to forget how to be a good singer to make the whole concept work, telling Variety, “It was a lot about kind of unlearning technique and forgetting how to breathe and allowing the song to completely come out of the character.” It’s curious, then, that Joker: Folie À Deux sounds so much like a musical in the film’s latest trailer. One has to wonder what Phillips planned to say when people actually heard the singing. We may not get to see Gaga actually performing a song in the new clip, but it’s unmistakably her voice belting out Frank Sinatra’s “That’s Life” behind the action. If this is her attempt at “unlearning technique,” she didn’t do a great job, because she sounds really good. It’s also not a great way to show that this is, again, not a musical.",

DeGeneres has said so in no uncertain terms; she even named the tour from whence this material sprung “Ellen’s Last Stand…Up Tour.” And on that tour, she vowed that after Ellen DeGeneres: For Your Approval, which premieres on Netflix on September 24, we’d never see her again.

Then again, Hollywood types rarely ever stick to their retirements, so it’s hard to imagine this will really be the last we see of her. Netflix is doing its best to make us believe the hype by reiterating that this is “The final comedy special of her historic career,” in which “Ellen gets personal and reveals what she’s been doing since being ‘kicked out of show business.’ From the mundane world of raising chickens and parallel parking to the harsh reality of becoming a brand name celebrity, she goes deep into her stand-up roots and brings the laughs through life’s most real and absurd realities.”\n\nIn the trailer, at least, DeGeneres isn’t leaning too heavily on saying goodbye or making her final bow overly nostalgic.

The train-wreck sit-down, wherein the Prince tried to deny claims that he had sex with a victim of notorious predator Jeffrey Epstein, destroyed his already wavering public image and led to him exiting the frontlines of the royal family. Moments this impactful certainly deserve the prestige-adaptation treatment, and this story is so juicy that it’s gotten two: the Netflix movie Scoop, released earlier this year, and now Prime Video’s A Very Royal Scandal, a TV drama about the before, during, and after of that infamous interview. Spread across three episodes, A Very Royal Scandal covers much of the same ground as Scoop: The news of Epstein’s arrest and subsequent death inspires renewed interest in the Prince’s friendship with him; his team seeks to quash the scandal lest it negatively impacts his dear mother; and Newsnight, a bastion of British journalism, scrambles to secure the interview before its rivals. The key difference here is perspective. Where Scoop was told from the point of view of former Newsnight producer Sam MacAlister, this is centered on Emily Maitlis, the journalist who conducted the interview. As played by Ruth Wilson (complete with a sharp blonde bob and a deepened voice that more evokes Elizabeth Holmes than Maitlis), she is ambitious but stifled by the BBC’s rules of impartiality. Attaining an interview with the beleaguered Duke is as much an opportunity for her to sink her teeth into a challenge as an old-school journalistic scoop.",

In the coming months, the app will also start rolling out “immersive previews” like the ones you see when you linger on a Netflix show page for too long. “A ton of our creators are really leaning into [a more traditional television format],” Christian Oestlien, YouTube’s VP of product management, told THR. “They’re doing 20 to 40 minute videos, there’s kind of a season arc to it, there’s multiple episodes in it, so we’re giving them the tooling to really create what we’re calling Creator Show Pages so that if you’re a fan of Michelle Khare (for example), you can go to her channel page and actually just kind of go on that sort of binge episodic experience that I think the lean back TV environment really lends itself to.”\n\nAccording to the company, these are more than just aesthetic tweaks.",

        "text": "Lionsgate clearly seeking to alienate Hollywood creatives with A.I. partnership Artificial Intelligence research firm Runway will create a new A.I. model \"customized on Lionsgate’s proprietary catalog\"\n\nSo this is pretty gross: Lionsgate, the film and television studio behind franchises like John Wick, and The Hunger Games, films like The Fabelmans and La La Land, and shows like Yellowjackets, Mad Men, Weeds, and more, has entered into a “first-of-its-kind” partnership with artificial intelligence research firm Runway. The partnership is “centered around the creation and training of a new AI model, customized on Lionsgate’s proprietary catalog.”\n\nWhat does that mean, exactly? Well, your guess is as good as any; there aren’t many details about what, specifically, the model will do. The press release emphasizes no less than three times that this partnership is meant to “augment” the work of filmmakers and creatives. Runway says the model will generate “cinematic video that can be further iterated using Runway’s suite of controllable tools.” And as we all know, there’s nothing creatives love more than augmenting their work through further iteration. Augmenting through iteration is the wellspring from which all great films are born! Lionsgate Vice Chair Michael Burns claims that “Several of our filmmakers are already excited about its potential applications to their pre-production and post-production process,” which may be true. Some notable industry figures, like Harmony Korine, have expressed willingness to engage with A.I. as a “tool” (“It’s another paintbrush. It’s another color,” Korine said last year).",

Last week, when a bunch of non-metal heads probably learned that the “Jane Says” rockers had reunited for the first time in 14 years in the first place, lead singer Perry Farrell made headlines for taking a swing at guitarist Dave Navarro onstage. The band apologized after a video of Farrell getting literally dragged off the stage spread across the internet, and canceled the rest of the tour shortly after. Now, they have a new song out. Let us breathe, Jane’s Addiction! If the track, titled “True Love,” is a eulogy for the band, it sure is an ironic one. “When I first felt true love, I was very young/I tried to describe it to my friends/You’re floating in something that’s way over your head/Wading in the waters of true love,” Farrell sings, before proclaiming that he’s “Yearning to be again with my true love” at the end of the ballad. According to NME, the band debuted the song live in London earlier this year and have played it at a handful of shows since. It was presumably scheduled to come out this week regardless of the fight, and the band (or their managers) decided not to let it crumble into obscurity. The artists have been totally silent about the release on social media, however, so we may never know.",

Directed from a screenplay co-written by Kevin Coughlin and Ryan Grassby, the film follows a young mother and her two sons who reside in a secluded forest cabin that was built with love—and ample spiritual protection—by elder relatives who felt an evil presence slowly encroaching toward them. Melding survival, psychological, and supernatural elements, Never Let Go is a thrilling ride in its entirety, a feat achieved by the stellar performances from its core trio. Even if the film’s mythology is never fully unraveled, Aja’s tension-crafting easily makes up for the odd narrative misstep. Young twin brothers Samuel (Anthony B. Jenkins) and Nolan (Percy Daggs IV) have only ever explored their rustic, hand-carved home and the overgrown greenery that directly surrounds it. They haven’t even had the luxury of running around in the wilderness, as their Momma (Halle Berry) demands that they all tie themselves to ropes that remain tethered to the property whenever they wish to step off the front porch. You see, Momma’s parents imbued the house with a divine aura that deters malicious spirits from entering, but as soon as one loses contact with the property, they are instantly vulnerable to possession. Therefore, the rope provides a holy loophole. During one of their routine expeditions into the forest to hunt for sustenance, Samuel trips and is accidentally freed from the rope’s grip. Momma swoops in just in time, reconnecting her son to the rope just as a bloody, fork-tongued creature advances toward the boy; interestingly, only she can see these monsters, a fact that makes Nolan increasingly suspicious of his mother’s fervent belief in the metaphysical.",

Souther, the singer-songwriter who co-wrote tracks with the Eagles, Linda Ronstadt, James Taylor, Bonnie Raitt, and more, has died. A representative confirmed to Rolling Stone that Souther died peacefully at home in New Mexico; no cause of death was given. He was 78 years old. Souther was born in Detroit, Michigan, and raised in Amarillo, Texas. In the ’60s, he moved to Los Angeles and began collaborating with Glenn Frey; the pair briefly formed the duo Longbranch Pennywhistle and released one eponymous album in 1970. However, they went on to continue a fruitful partnership. Souther helped write Eagles hits including “Best of My Love,” “James Dean,” “New Kid In Town,” “Doolin-Dalton,” and “Heartache Tonight.”\n\nSouther penned several tracks with his then-girlfriend Ronstadt, including “Faithless Love,” and collaborated with her on numerous duets like “If You Have Crying Eyes” from his solo album Black Rose and “Hearts Against The Wind,” which was featured on the soundtrack for the film Urban Cowboy. He also worked with James Taylor, co-writing their duet “Her Town Too” which reached number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1981.

Beast Games, the upcoming Prime series from YouTube personality MrBeast, is the latest game show to face allegations of mistreatment and “chaos” from its contestants. Now, five of those anonymous participants are suing MrBeast (real name Jimmy Donaldson) and Amazon for, among other things, failure to pay minimum wages and overtime, sexual harassment and failure to prevent harassment, negligent infliction of emotional distress, failure to provide uninterrupted meal breaks, and false advertising. The suit is currently seeking class action status. With over 1,000 participants competing for a single $5 million cash prize, Beast Games is touting itself as the largest reality show in history, according to Variety. MrBeast is known on YouTube for over-the-top challenges like “I Spent 50 Hours Buried Alive” and his own version of Squid Game, which he launched two years ago. Still, participants of the latest challenge are saying he wasn’t remotely up to the task of organizing something on this scale. “It’s a Fyre Fest kind of feeling,” an anonymous crew member who “left the production early” told Rolling Stone. “There’s a reason why this level of production hasn’t been attempted before, and it certainly should never have been attempted without people that know what they are doing.”\n\nAccording to the redacted lawsuit, Beast Games contestants were deprived of medical care, food, sleep and basic hygiene.",

Fox’s adaptation of the Karl Alberg series of books strikes a tone reminiscent of 2000s-era WB shows like Everwood and Gilmore Girls: It’s lightly comedic, airy, and everything is centered around a quirky small town. In this case, however, there’s a crucial bit of darkness woven in, not just from the titular killing but from the suggestion of the secrets that lurk under the surface of every small town. This is well-worn territory, sure, but the show strikes a jovial enough tone and manages to be somewhat unique without coming across as discomforting. Mercifully, Murder In A Small Town doesn’t play up the folksiness of its setting or the out-of-touch nature of its protagonist. Karl Alberg (Rossif Sutherland, son of Donald) has moved to a small coastal town from the big city, but he’s adjusted rather well. We’re introduced to him as he goes on an online date with Cassandra Mitchell (WB veteran Kristin Kreuk), a local librarian with attachment issues. The show’s setup actually has a lot more to juggle than the murder, because there’s also Edwina Yen (Mya Lowe), a new hire from Philadelphia, and George Wilcox (special guest star James Cromwell), who’s connected to the victim somehow. Murder In A Small Town is not always the cleanest. And at times, the series resembles something more like a small-town drama than a procedural, laying the groundwork for what could be overarching storylines or just background details.",

Well, you’d better know a guy who knows a guy, because movies and television will have you believe that only a fixer can make a scandal like this go away. Fixers are anonymous, clear-headed individuals who are called in to maintain an important reputation or clean blood-stained carpets. They will come wearing black gloves and give you a step-by-step process to make sure messy, illicit activities never attract any suspicion, and apparently everybody has one on file: Hollywood, the mob, law firms, even the government. Smooth-talking, diplomatic, and meticulous criminals appear everywhere in film and TV, and by casting George Clooney and Brad Pitt as two “lone wolf” fixers reluctantly teaming up for a high-profile clean-up, Jon Watts’ Wolfs clearly cashes in on all the outlaw characters these two archetypal A-listers have played throughout their careers. Watching a fixer (also known as a bagman or cleaner when focused on more specific tasks) pull off a coverup is satisfying and thrilling to watch when it’s done with finesse, but the real-world version of the stock character is queasy to think about. Why should wealthy people and important institutions get to avoid accountability for acting recklessly and unjustly, just because they want their public-facing image—and by extension, their road to money and power—to stay intact? Because of the tension between cinematic thrills and their real-world connotations, the amoral nature of fixers often incites ethical and existential crises if they’re leading a film or given an extended arc on television.",

With so much emphasis on opening weekend, it’s unsurprising that Furiosa would be pushed out of a thousand theaters in one week. Word of mouth certainly used to be a thing, but there’s no reason it still can’t be. Wrapping up a six-month run at New York’s beloved IFC Center arthouse, Alice Rohrwacher’s enchanting La Chimera opened in March and hasn’t left the screen since. The movie is currently the theater’s longest-running film of the decade, and its miraculous run comes to an end this weekend. To celebrate the film’s unprecedented and inspiring success, Neon, the film’s distributor, is buying out the theater so everyone can say buona notte to the movie the right way. Tickets to La Chimera’s final shows at 11 a.m. and 9:45 p.m. on Thursday, September 19, will be on Neon. Those tickets are only available in person at the box office 30 minutes before each show, with a limit of two free tickets per person. We can’t recommend La Chimera enough. It’s a dreamy and intoxicating romance starring Challengers’ Josh O’Connor as Arthur, a desperate grave robber haunted by missing and presumably dead love, and Isabella Rosellini as a woman with too many daughters and granddaughters.

A healthy mix of each is present in ABC’s latest procedural. And there’s nothing extraordinary about it except its genius protagonist (and lead star). In High Potential, a terrific Kaitlin Olson plays Morgan Gilroy, whose high IQ, advanced cognitive abilities, and photographic memory make her stand out among a slew of detectives at the LAPD, where she works as a mere cleaner. Any longtime viewer of television will recognize Morgan’s personality and skills aren’t particularly unique. She’s an amalgamation of various beloved TV characters. You know, the smarties who use their unique observations to solve a crime in a 40-minute episode, from Lieutenant Columbo and Adrian Monk to Temperance Brennan to Spencer Reid. Of course, the direct inspiration for her and the show itself is the French-Belgium series HPI, which series creator Drew Goddard (The Good Place) adapts into a standard American procedural. It’s not an original idea by any means, but perhaps that’s High Potential’s biggest selling point. ABC’s drama yearns to be the next big go-to network TV show to invest in for several years, thanks to its broad-strokes character dynamics, mysteries, and charming heroine that you can’t help but root for. (It’s similar to what CBS is attempting with Elsbeth because who doesn’t want weekly comfort viewing back?) As seen in the pilot, Morgan’s rare abilities don’t make her any less relatable.",

Mickey 17, the long-awaited, long-delayed follow-up to Parasite, is finally making its way to theaters. Warner Bros., which should get credit for actually releasing this movie (we were getting nervous), will release Mickey 17 in the United States on January 31, 2025, more than two years after production concluded. It’s hard to imagine what concerned Warner Bros. about Mickey 17 because it looks like a totally normal movie featuring a movie star doing a regular Tobey Maguire accent. Pattinson stars as Mickey 1 through 17, a go-nowhere Earthling so desperate to leave his home planet that he signs up to be an expendable, a grunt worker expected to die on the job only to be 3-D printed back into existence. While Mickey seems fine dying for a living, things get a little complicated once there are overlaps between versions. When Mickey wakes up in bed with Mickey, the instinct is to kill Mickey—see: a super normal two-and-a-half hour movie in which Pattinson routinely dies or kills himself or allows someone else to kill him. Bong is known for taking big swings like this. Between his Hitchcockian satires, Bong has filled time with special effects spectacles with deep wells of emotion, absurd humor, socio-political undercurrents, and bizarre creatures. To that end, the $150 million Mickey 17 looks like it surpasses the scale of Snowpiercer.",

Per the band’s website, REO Speedwagon is breaking up. The Speedwagon will be decommissioned effective January 1, 2025. Issues within the group began when bassist Bruce Hall took time off the road to undergo back surgery, a procedure he’s still rehabbing. Despite Hall’s desire to start touring again, the group came to a “consensus opinion that he had not recovered sufficiently to be able to perform at the level the fans have come to expect.” It was a decision “Bruce respected,” and he remains grateful to Matt Bissonette, who filled in for Hall over the summer tour. However, “the complex situation” created “irreconcilable differences” between bassist Hall and singer and guitarist Kevin Cronin. “So, it is with great sadness that we announce REO Speedwagon will cease touring effective January 1, 2025,” the band writes. “Neal, Kevin, and Bruce thank their fans for all their years of loyal support and for giving back to the band such wonderful memories that will remain with each of them forever.” They really did say that they’re going to keep on loving you. Formed in Chicago in 1966, REO Speedwagon has gone through over two dozen members over nearly 60 years but has been consistent since 1989. However, as age has begun to catch up with its members in recent years, some have hung up the banner.

Uber has a whole “Uber for teens” campaign with morose ads about kids getting cut from the football team and texting their parents when they’re on the way home.

Beginning on Tuesday, new users under the age of 18 will automatically be put on a Teen Account, while teens who already have accounts will be switched over in the next 60 days. The new settings automatically make teen accounts private, rather than public; users under 16 will need a parent’s permission to switch to public accounts. On Teen Accounts, users can only message with people they follow, and there will be a setting allowing parents to see with whom their teens are messaging. Teens will be able to choose “age-appropriate” topics for posts fed to them by the algorithm (which their parents can also see), and all Teen Accounts will be placed into “sleep mode” restricting users’ access to the app from 10 PM to 7 AM. Instagram’s Adam Mosseri announced Teen Accounts on Good Morning America on Tuesday, saying the new setting is an attempt “to proactively address the top concerns that we’ve heard from parents about teens online.",

Just six days ago, the ascendant star charged onto the VMA stage in full Joan of Arc regalia for a fiery performance of “Good Luck, Babe!” complete with flaming arrows and armored dancers.

Casting is going to be a war of its own. According to the trade, a notice went out today seeking a young female actor to star in “the ultimate teenage girl coming of age story, set in the Hundred Years’ War.” Luhrmann is clearly set on that tagline, because he teased the same quote in an Instagram video a few weeks ago. If the director really is trying to frame the story of a young woman who was wrongfully burned at the stake for blasphemy by cross-dressing as a quirky bildungsroman, that would be… a choice. Still, we don’t really know anything as of this writing other than the fact that Warner Bros. is on board to produce and Luhrmann is currently calling the film either Jehanne or Jehanne d’Arc. If Luhrmann continues his patterns and, hypothetically, makes Jehanne into a musical, Roan could actually be the perfect choice to portray the young heroine; she certainly has the pipes.",

Beyer had just left an abusive 18-year marriage when she met Finch while at a treatment center for PTSD. She got swept up in Finch’s Hollywood lifestyle and in her various untruths.

Murphy recently told Vanity Fair that he had his eye on the project, an adaptation of Claire Keegan’s acclaimed 2020 novel of the same name, before he ever stepped foot in Christopher Nolan’s vision of Los Alamos. It was there that he pitched the script, written by Enda Walsh, to his co-star Matt Damon, who “loved” it. “I remember saying that it’s a different film, but it would share some thematic crossover with Manchester By The Sea, which Matt also produced,” Murphy recalled. “It was like I was pitching between Manchester By The Sea and Doubt.” Damon and Ben Affleck’s Artists Equity signed on as producers and everything came together “remarkably quick” from there. The film, which just released its first trailer, is a notable change of pace for Murphy from last year’s massive blockbuster. The actor goes back to his Irish roots as Bill Furlong, a coal merchant confronted with “his past and the complicit silence of a small Irish town controlled by the Catholic Church,” according to the film’s logline. The 1980s-set story was loosely inspired by the Magdalene Laundries, a dark chapter in Irish history in which Catholic nuns isolated and abused single, pregnant women until the final facility closed in 1996. ﻿\n\n“It’s so seemingly simple, but it’s incredibly complex, actually, when you look at it,” Murphy said of the story.",

Per CBS News, the music mogul has been charged with sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution. At a press conference (via CNN), US attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams said that “between at least 2008 and the present, Combs abused, threatened and coerced victims to fulfill his sexual desires, protect his reputation and conceal his conduct.”\n\nProsecutors are seeking to detain Combs before the trial, per CNN. The District Attorney’s office will argue that Combs is a danger while free, having already attempted to obstruct the investigation; he is believed to have access to weapons and has been accused of violence, bribery, and intimidation in order to cover his crimes. He’s also considered to be a flight risk, given his resources and access to planes. “We are not done. This investigation is ongoing and I encourage anyone with information about this case to come forward and to do it quickly,” Williams said at the press conference. According to the indictment, Combs has been accused of a “persistent and pervasive pattern of abuse toward women and other individuals. This abuse was, at times, verbal, emotional, physical and sexual.” He was able to manipulate his female partners and others in his sphere “by, among other things, obtaining and distributing narcotics to them, controlling their careers, leveraging his financial support and threatening to cut off the same, and using intimidation and violence.”\n\nFurther, the record executive is accused of using his business, “including certain employees, to carry out, facilitate and cover up his abuse and commercial sex.” His businesses allegedly served as a means for Combs and his associates to engage in “sex trafficking, forced labor, interstate transportation for purposes of prostitution, coercion and enticement to engage in prostitution, narcotics offenses, kidnapping, arson, bribery and obstruction of justice.” The indictment alleges Combs secured loyalty from both associates and victims through violence, threats, and coercion.",

Since 1964, this (sadly fictional) spot has “cater[ed] to lunatics who take a beating.” And in OMITB‘s fourth episode, the haven is intruded by three desperate podcast hosts. Charles, Oliver, and Mabel’s inquiry into Sazz’s regular bar leads to meeting many eccentric folks, including a Paul Rudd lookalike played by…Paul Rudd! They learn about Sazz’s last day, part of which she spent at the watering hole. Charles also helps her bar colleagues throw a traditional stuntman funeral, which involves bashing bottles and a brawl. The episode is a mixed bag, continuing OMITB season four’s trend of—dare I say it—being slightly lackluster. It’s not a bad half-hour, to be clear, as there are solid one-liners, and Steve Martin and Martin Short remain stellar. Yet the arcs don’t feel fun or suspenseful enough. The installment’s strongest aspect is the internal and external ways in which Charles continues to handle his grief. Aside from the usual banter, it’s nice to see the three leads face the emotional ramifications of the crimes they talk about all day. This has happened before in the show, with how Mabel dealt with her old Arconia friends’ deaths in season one and the impacts of Bunny (Jayne Houdyshell) and Ben Glenroy’s (Rudd) murders. The trio is committed to the podcast, but this shit can get dark and affect their lives.",

The Self Reliance actor is taking on her own historic serial killer in her directorial debut Woman Of The Hour, which tells the story of Rodney Alcala, also known as the Dating Game Killer. Kendrick, who also produced the film, stars as Cheryl Bradshaw, a real-life Dating Game contestant who had the misfortune of selecting Alcala when he appeared on the show in the midst of a years-long murder spree in 1978. It really is a “stranger-than-fiction story,” as the film’s logline proclaims. Alcala was tried three times and eventually died in 2021 of unspecified natural causes. ﻿\n\nThe film’s first teaser seems to find Bradshaw and Alcala on their winning post-game date, a thoroughly uncomfortable affair that sees Bradshaw caught for trying to curve Alcala by the end of the evening. In real life, Bradshaw refused to go out with Alcala at all, saying she found him “creepy.” Noting that Alcala killed at least four people after his appearance, crime profiler Pat Brown suggested that this rejection could have had a profound effect on Alcala in a 2010 CNN article: “That is something he would not take too well. [Serial killers] don’t understand the rejection. They think that something is wrong with that girl: ‘She played me. She played hard to get. '”\n\n(Unrelated to this film, which checks in on him years before, but for Alcala’s third trial in 2010, in which he stood suspect for five separate murders, he bizarrely chose to act as his own attorney and played Arlo Guthrie’s “Alice’s Restaurant” as part of his closing argument, which really warrants an entire film of its own.",

        "text": "In 2008, filmmaker Mike Leigh released Happy-Go-Lucky, a bright and breezy comedy (as alluded to by its title) that still managed to have the occasional dramatic bite. Hard Truths provides the antithesis, a film about sisters that plays as an unsettling social drama full of tears, bitterness, and familial consternation, but also contains a dash of humor that makes it far more than just about the dourness of a grieving daughter. Leigh’s films are filled with deeply realized characters, quotidian situations that manage to feel epic, and exquisite interplay of dialogue that feels extremely casual but, of course, is deeply calculated on the page before a frame is shot. Despite Hard Truths’ somewhat claustrophobic interior settings, Leigh along with his long-time cinematographer Dick Pope use subtle camera movements and clever compositions to keep even the most austere spaces engaging. Just as Leigh’s proclivity for chamber piece-like narratives is well known, his ability to showcase supreme acting talent is equally legendary. Here the main focus is on Marianne Jean-Baptiste in an astonishing turn, a wild and explosive character realized with multiple layers of nuance that lay sometimes hidden amongst the wild rantings. Oscar-nominated for Leigh’s 1996 Palme d’Or winner Secrets & Lies, Jean-Baptiste plays a force of nature, mining a deep vein of acerbic misery. Jean-Baptiste plays Pansy, the mother to the taciturn Moses (Tuwaine Barrett) and married to his henpecked father Curtley (David Webber). Pansy’s proclivity for confrontation is unrelenting, be it in the confines of her home or in the checkout line at a grocery store. It’s a character that could easily become tiresome, a two-dimensional ranting bulldozer, laying waste to all those in her path.",

But during the pandemic when documentaries “really exploded” (in Beckham’s opinion) and he realized it had been ten years since leaving the pitch, he decided to give it a try. “As much as people think they know everything about us they don’t really and we don’t really let those doors open to our house,” he said, but he knew it was “the right time.”\n\nOf course, Beckham emphasizing his own discomfort with the process is also a way to deter some of the criticism that the doc was a vanity project. Given that Beckham’s own production company made the doc, could it really be an objective assessment of his life and accomplishments? Beckham would argue yes, given his choice in documentarian: “When I met Fisher [Stevens] I knew this is the man that will make me feel really uncomfortable and I knew I had to feel uncomfortable to make the documentary we made,” said Beckham, adding that he didn’t influence the process: “Through the whole documentary, from Day One I said, ‘I don’t want to see anything until it comes out.’ … I didn’t go into the edit, I didn’t see any cuts, I wanted to let Fisher have that control.",

This is learning something completely new that is so far out of my comfort zone. Not only is it going to be physically tough, because I spend most of my life drinking and I’m not a gym person, but mentally, I think it’s going to be draining. Although I’m not a particularly educated person, I love to learn. I’ve always said Strictly is the one show I wouldn’t do. I needed a lot of persuading. I still do. Everyone said I’d enjoy it, and as miserable as I come across, I actually do! Why did you say yes this year? Pete: I’ve realised life’s too short. I lost my nan two years ago, and it’s the worst thing that’s ever happened to me. I didn’t get a chance to make her proud before she died. Trying new things, and being a better version of myself, is important to me, because hopefully, she’s watching, and she’ll be proud. She grew up watching Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.

As of now, there's no confirmed release date for Monsters season 3. More like this\n\nHowever, Netflix has confirmed that production will kick off later this September. Seeing as the first Dahmer series was released in 2022 and the second has been released in September 2024, we would assume that the third season would follow the same release pattern and be released in a couple of years.

The new nine-part Netflix series seeks to chronicle the true story of the Menendez brothers, who were convicted in 1996 for the murders of their parents José and Mary Louise 'Kitty' Menendez. At the time – and still to this day – the brothers maintain that they murdered their parents in an act of self-defence born out of years of sexual abuse. This second instalment in the Monsters franchise continues on from the controversial Dahmer series, which landed on our screens back in 2022 – lest we forget the many important questions the series raised around the honouring of victim's stories versus the romanticisation of serial killers in the true crime TV genre. More like this\n\nAlthough the families of Dahmer's victims spoke out against the series and series creator Ryan Murphy, Netflix renewed the series for more – thus making it an entire franchise. Oh, the joy! So, have the team behind the true crime anthology series learnt their lesson this time round? You'd think so. But it seems as though questions around ethical storytelling fell by the wayside when the original series scooped up Golden Globe Awards, a BAFTA, an Emmy and countless other nominations. Who cares about viewer reaction when the awards can do the talking, right? \"We’re all one traumatic event away from the worst day of your life being reduced to your neighbour’s favourite binge show,\" Eric Perry, a relative of Dahmer victim Errol Lindsey, said at the time of the first season's release.",

Speaking to The Sydney Morning Herald, Moriarty admitted that the idea for Apples Never Fall came to her after listening to various podcasts in the Covid-19 lockdown. She said: \"Sadly, there are multiple cases where a woman goes missing and the husband is the chief suspect in her murder.

The gap between seasons 5 and season 6 was far longer than usual, lasting for four full years. There are a number of potential reasons for this break - for one thing, Charlie Brooker and his creative partner Annabel Jones left their production company House of Tomorrow in January 2020, leaving the rights to the show with parent company Endemol Shine Group. This meant that until a deal was arranged, which evidently one was, no more seasons could be produced.

Television, for reintroducing fans to this new iteration of liars who band together to fight the latest creepy villain terrifying Millwood,” the streamer said in a statement. “Their unique and modern creative vision — combined with the immense talent of our cast and crew – gave the series a fun, horror-filled point of view that paid tribute to its original Rosewood roots.

Ahead of the show’s 2022 launch, the streamer even released a video playing up Gaiman’s wonder at touring the sets, following him as he marveled at seeing his creations in physical form for the first time. So when Netflix put out a behind-the-scenes peek at The Sandman Season 2 on Thursday, Gaiman’s absence from the video was notable — particularly in light of recent sexual assault allegations made against the beloved fantasy author. On the Tortoise Media podcast Master: The Allegations Against Neil Gaiman, released in early July, a 23-year-old woman accused Gaiman of sexually assaulting her within hours of their first meeting at his New Zealand residence, where she worked as nanny to his child. Gaiman has said that only consensual digital penetration occurred during their three-week relationship. A second accuser says she was 18 when she met Gaiman at a book signing, then began a relationship with him at age 20, during which she submitted to “rough and painful” sex that “she neither wanted nor enjoyed.” Gaiman denied any unlawful behavior. Another two women have since come forward with their own allegations, all of which Gaiman denies and says he is “disturbed” by. TVLine hears that Gaiman is still contractually an executive producer on The Sandman. His name, however, is conspicuously absent from the streamer’s official writeup of the new season. TVLine has reached out to Gaiman and Netflix for comment. Earlier in September, our sister site Deadline reported that Gaiman offered to step back from Season 3 of Prime Video‘s Good Omens, a series on which he serves as showrunner, executive producer and writer.",

The series “centered on the town’s orphanage and its residents who meet tremendous challenges while creating a hopeful, faith-filled community on the cusp of change in the frontier town,” according to the official logline. Ryan-James Hatanaka co-starred as Lillian’s love interest, Mountie Gabriel. In the Season 1 finale, Grace departed for London — and when the series resurfaced on Great American Family in 2021, Hudon did not return. Lillian revealed that her sister had put down roots in the UK; her Season 1 love interest Chuck (played by former series regular Greg Hovanessian) also skipped town. Jocelyn Hudon & Morgan Kohan in When Hope Calls Season 1 Shane Mahood/Hallmark Entertainment (Courtesy of Everett Collection)\n\nAccording to GAF, while the opening episodes of Season 2 will “pay homage to the romance” between Lillian and Gabriel, “new characters are introduced that are seminal to the orphanage and children, the sprawling farms and ranch lands, and to the town of Brookfield.” Those include Cindy Busby (Cedar Cove), who has been cast as Nora; Christopher Russell (UnREAL), who will play a new mountie, Michael; and Nick Bateman (A Christmas Miracle With Daisy), who will inhabit the role of Wyatt.",

The series explores a Gotham City still reeling from the explosions, flooding and death caused by the Riddler, which an opening news report informs us spared the wealthy suburbs while hitting poor neighborhoods hardest, particularly Crown Points. In the midst of this, the death of Carmine Falcone (played by John Turturro in The Batman, with Mark Strong glimpsed in a photo in the premiere that sets up some flashbacks he’ll appear in later) has created a power vacuum for Gotham’s mob world, with Carmine’s son, Alberto Falcone (Michael Zegen), the chosen successor. Meanwhile, Falcone underling Oswald “Oz” Cobb, aka The Penguin (Farrell), clearly has plans of his own. He breaks into Carmine’s office at the shut-down Iceberg Lounge, discovering files that include spy photos of Falcone syndicate underboss Johnny Viti (Michael Kelly) in bed with a woman. When Oz is caught by Alberto, he hands over jewels he also found, awkwardly claiming he was only grabbing everything to protect it for Alberto from others taking it. Alberto humors Oz and then succumbs to his addictions when Oz offers him Drops, the drug introduced in The Batman that is a big part of the Falcones’ business. As Alberto sits with Oz, he tells him they are working on a newer, better drug that will revolutionize their operation. Alberto also shows off his ring, which was worn by Carmine before him, but originally belonged to their imprisoned rival, Salvatore Maroni, before Carmine betrayed him.",

In the above first look at Season 2 (premiering Thursday, Dec. 26) — released as part of the streamer’s Geeked Week 2024 — Seong Gi-hun is pulled back into the deadly world of the game, which “will not stop,” the teaser ominously warns. Across nine episodes, Squid Game Season 1 followed Seong Gi-hun (played by Emmy winner Lee Jung-jae), a gambling-prone divorcé, as he and 455 other strangers were whisked away to a secret island complex to compete in a series of children’s games all given decidedly deadly spins. Ultimately emerging from the ordeal as the sole survivor, Gi-hun made tracks for the airport to visit his daughter in Los Angeles. But when he saw the man who groomed him for the game doing the same with another stranger, Gi-hun snatched a calling card from the stranger, dialed the number and announced his intention to find out who exactly the game’s organizers were and why they engage in the atrocities they do. While the finale left us wondering exactly how Gi-hun will do that, the Season 2 synopsis — coupled with the video below — makes clear that he will tracksuit up again, as No. 456, and step back into the deadly arena. Players – it’s almost time. Squid Game Season 2 arrives December 26. pic.twitter.com/IVp5V48rwI — Squid Game (@squidgame) August 11, 2024\n\n“Three years after winning Squid Game, Player 456 remains determined to find the people behind the game and put an end to their vicious sport,” the official synopsis tells us.",

In a post on X in which he hyped the inclusion of fellow AEW star Samoa Joe in the upcoming Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii video game, Omega noted that he is \"not medically cleared\" to compete:\n\nThe manner in which Omega revealed the information suggests he could be joking, but he has indeed battled his fair share of health issues since the inception of AEW. His most recent ailment is a bout with diverticulitis. When Omega appeared on an episode of Dynamite in May, he said he required surgery and noted that doctors told him he was lucky to be alive. Omega was then written off TV again due to an attack by Elite members The Young Bucks, Jack Perry and Kazuchika Okada.

He traveled to Auburn in March before heading to Kansas State on Aug. 30 and Kansas on Sept. 6.\n\nAfter leaving North Carolina, he'll visit Alabama on Sept. 27 and Baylor on Oct. 4. His final stop will be at BYU on Oct. 11.\n\nAt 6'9\" and 210 pounds, Dybantsa is able to use his height and wingspan to pull up over smaller defenders and consistently generate his own offense.

        "text": "Kevin Sabitus/Getty Images\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens and running back Justice Hill reportedly agreed to a contract extension Friday. According to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, Hill and the Ravens came to terms on a two-year, $6 million deal. Hill, 26, has spent his entire five-year career in Baltimore, and he is now under contract with the team through the 2026 campaign thanks to his new pact. Baltimore originally selected Hill in the fourth round of the 2019 NFL draft after he enjoyed a standout collegiate career at Oklahoma State that included two 1,000-yard rushing seasons and 30 total rushing touchdowns over three seasons. Despite that, Hill had a fairly limited role in the Ravens' offense over his first three seasons, averaging about 182 rushing yards, eight catches for 49 yards and less than one touchdown per year during that stretch. Hill was utilized far more often last season, though, perhaps due in large part to the fact that running back J.K. Dobbins was lost for the season after just one game, while veteran running back Melvin Gordon struggled. Gus Edwards was the Ravens' go-to running back as a rusher last season, but Hill was the primary third-down back, and his stats improved as a result. In fact, Hill set career highs across the board with 84 carries for 387 yards and three touchdowns, plus 28 receptions for 206 yards and a score. The Ravens' backfield underwent some significant changes during the offseason, as both Edwards and Dobbins signed with the Los Angeles Chargers in free agency, while Baltimore signed longtime Tennessee Titans running back and potential future Hall of Famer Derrick Henry.",

However, the Badgers installed a new offense in his junior year, which undoubtedly played a factor in his output.\n\nAllen wasted no time proving his prognosticators wrong, as he's been one of New York's most impactful players over the past two weeks. The 20-year-old, who is the youngest player in the NFL, scored his first touchdown on a pass from Aaron Rodgers and rushed for the go-ahead score in the fourth quarter of the Jets' Week 2 win against the Tennessee Titans.\n\nAllen was voted as the AFC Rookie of the Week, and he followed that up by recording a team-high 55 yards in Thursday night's win against the New England Patriots. He's impressed with his ability to run through contact and punish defenders whenever he touches the ball.\n\nThe Jets appear to have found a gem with Allen falling to the fourth round of the draft. He's combined with third-year star Breece Hall to create one of the most promising backfield duos in the NFL.",

Speaking to Larry Brooks of the New York Post (h/t B/R Open Ice), Miller said his curly, blond hairdo is \"fully inspired\" by wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr.'s look during his time with the New York Giants:\n\nBeckham, who is currently with the Miami Dolphins, was one of the NFL's biggest names while he was a member of the Giants for five seasons from 2014 to 2018, earning three Pro Bowl selections during that time. OBJ took the NFL by storm as a rookie in 2014 with 92 receptions for 1,305 yards and 12 touchdowns en route to being named NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year. Beckham averaged 96 grabs for 1,374 yards and nearly 12 touchdowns over his first three seasons, and while his play was likely the biggest reason for his popularity, his personality and look were part of the package as well. He has never quite been the same player since suffering a broken leg in 2017 and a torn ACL in 2020, but he was a key part of the Los Angeles Rams winning the Super Bowl in 2021 after they acquired him from the Cleveland Browns. Beckham also tore his ACL for a second time in the Super Bowl, causing him to miss all of 2022 before playing for the Baltimore Ravens last season. He has yet to make his debut for the Dolphins and is currently on the physically unable to perform list, and while Beckham may be reaching the twilight of his career, perhaps Miller can take the torch from him in terms of sports superstardom in New York City.",

Criswell is the third player to start at under center for the Tar Heels already this season, as they deal with the wake of former Texas A&M transfer Max Johnson's season-ending injury. This will be Criswell's second career start for the Tar Heels, though he hasn't been first off the bench since a win against Wofford in 2021 -- his true sophomore season. Former three-star quarterback Conner Harrell led the offense in wins against Charlotte and NC Central. Though North Carolina won those two contests by an average of 26.5 points, Harrell struggled to consistently move the offense. He threw an interception against the 49ers and then missed on four of his first six passes against NC Central. The 6-foot-1 and 230-pound Criswell came in for North Carolina's third drive against the Eagles and immediately led three consecutive scoring drives, two of which ended in touchdowns. Criswell completed 14 of his 23 pass attempts for 161 yards and one touchdown in the 45-10 win. He also rushed for 16 yards on three carries. Criswell's journey comes full circle\n\nCriswell has had one of the more unique transfer portal journeys, emblematic of the modern era of college football. He initially signed with North Carolina in 2020 as a four-star prospect out of Morrilton, Arkansas. Criswell spent the first few years of his career backing up the likes of Sam Howell and Drake Maye, earning most of his playing time in clean-up duty against overmatched opponents.

The intangibles Stroud possessed were there immediately. \"I just saw a savviness. I saw someone that was cool under pressure.

Will it be the Liberty, who are looking for the first title in franchise history? The Aces, who are trying to complete a threepeat? Or perhaps an old stalwart like the Lynx, who could win it all for a record-setting fifth time? While the league's best and brightest will have a big say on which team completes the journey, whichever team wins will need some big moments from its supporting cast along the way. With that, here's a look at the biggest X-factor heading into the playoffs. 1. New York Liberty: Leonie Fiebich\n\nThe 24-year-old German rookie was not on anyone's radar coming into the season. Even Liberty head coach Sandy Brondello was barely playing her early on. Over the course of the summer, though, the 6-foot-4 Fiebich turned into one of the team's most important players. Her size and versatility allowed them to maintain the top seed despite long-term absences for Courtney Vandersloot and Betnijah Laney-Hamilton, and will prove extremely important come playoff time. She finished seventh in the league in 3-point percentage (43.3) and her mobility at her size allows them to play some huge defensive lineups. 2. Minnesota Lynx: Bridget Carleton\n\nThe Lynx are a true collective, and perhaps no player embodies that more than Carleton, who does all the little things the Lynx need to win. She's a solid defender who can handle multiple positions, finished fifth in the league in 3-point percentage (44.4) and rarely makes mistakes.",

Despite that success, however, last season was a complete disaster after the departure of the Italian manager, who was later on hired by the Italian FA and became the Italy head coach. Napoli owner Aurelio De Laurentiis, who just celebrated his 20th year of ownership at the club, decided to appoint Rudi Garcia, but things didn't go well and in November was sacked and replaced by former Azzurri coach Walter Mazzarri. Once again, it didn't work out and after another sacking Napoli appointed Francesco Calzona for the final part of the season. The Azzurri were only waiting for the summer and to end a disappointing season as soon as possible, so that they could plan a better future. The club hired a new sport director: Giovanni Manna, formerly of Juventus, replacing Cristiano Giuntoli, the mastermind of the recent success of the club, who made the reverse trip and became the new sport director of the Bianconeri. Manna, a young director with clear ideas, sat down with De Laurentiis to hire the new head coach. Napoli needed a manager with a strong personality, a winning mentality and the will to bring the club to the success in the shortest time possible. That's why there was only one name that could match this ambition: Antonio Conte.

While he was expected to miss multiple weeks, Love will be a game-time decision for Sunday's game, Packers head coach Matt LaFleur said on Friday. \"He's doing everything in his power,\" LaFleur said on Love's Week 3 status. \"We'll give it to game time.\" Love practiced Wednesday for the first time since suffering the injury during Green Bay's season-opening loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. He was limited that day as well as during Thursday and Friday's practices. \"There's a lot of boxes (to check),\" Love said of the recovery process. \"What it feels like to take those drops, be in the live fire … the trainers are doing a good job of monitoring me and seeing how I'm doing and how I'm reacting to every play. They'll be the ones to clear me when the time comes.\" Love said that, while being exclusively a pocket passer on Sunday isn't realistic, he acknowledged that he doesn't need to be able to do everything he can normally do in order to play. Love was not medically cleared to play in Green Bay's home opener this past Sunday against the Indianapolis Colts. With Love looking on, backup Malik Willis went 12 of 14 that included a touchdown pass in Green Bay's 16-10 win. Willis was aided by a Packers rushing attack that gorged the Colts for 261 yards on 53 carries. Love was initially expected to be out anywhere from 2-6 weeks, so his practice participation this week would suggest his return may be on the earlier side of said timetable.",

The opportunity was three years in the making, a chance for Covey to prove he can play as big of a role in the offense as he does on special teams. \"I think it was awesome,\" said Eagles offensive coordinator Kellen Moore on Covey's performance. \"Great example of a guy who hops in there late in the week and is ready to roll.\" Covey was called to action after A.J. Brown tweaked his hamstring in practice late last week. Knowing his role in the offense, Jalen Hurts backed up his trust in Covey with six targets, leading to six catches for 23 yards. Covey also had a 7-yard and 14-yard catch taken away from two illegal man downfield penalties. \"The game plan wasn't too adjusted to what position I was going to play,\" Covey said. \"But, I mean, we have so much experience where I come in, we put Smitty back outside, put me in the slot and it's just working. It's just going to work as usual. \"I pride myself on separation above all things, because I can't afford to not have separation of myself. So my goal is to always have a yard more separation than anybody else, and I did it.\" With Brown still on the mend, Covey is going to get even more chances to catch passes in the coming weeks. The Eagles wideout has earned the trust of Jalen Hurts over the past few years, making him an easy target (pun intended) in the passing game.",

To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the franchise, Memphis will be wearing white Classic Edition throwback uniforms.\n\nIn 1995, the Vancouver Grizzlies made their NBA debut, and they played six miserable seasons before relocating to Memphis in 2001. A few years after the move, the franchise ditched the grizzly bear and \"Claw Ball\" logos in favor of more modern designs.\n\nNow, those old school logos are coming back with the Grizzlies honoring their roots. Along with the logos, the original colors of turquoise, bronze, red and black are making a comeback too.\n\nThis is the second time the Grizzlies have gone into the vault and brought back the Vancouver design. They did so in 2019-20 when celebrating their 25th anniversary, and the jerseys were a huge hit at the time.\n\nThe difference this time around is that the uniforms are white, as opposed to the turquoise look the team sported five years ago. On top of the new threads, the Grizzlies will also put in a throwback court for those select games as well.\n\nThe Grizzlies open their 30th anniversary season on the road against the Utah Jazz on Oct. 23, and their home-opener is slated for Oct. 26 against the Orlando Magic.

This comes after the quarterback was a limited participant during Thursday's practice after missing Wednesday's session with what the team listed as an ankle injury. Herbert himself got into more specifics surrounding the injury while speaking to reporters on Friday.\n\nThe 26-year-old noted that he suffered a high-ankle sprain during last Sunday's win over the Carolina Panthers. Herbert added that it's \"yet to be decided\" whether he'll play in Week 3 and added that the pain is \"not great\"\n\n\"Thankfully, it's only Friday,\" Herbert said, via ESPN.\n\nHerbert was present for the final practice of the week on Friday, and reporters on site spotted the quarterback's right ankle heavily taped up.\n\nJustin Herbert LAC • QB • #10 CMP% 67.4 YDs 274 TD 3 INT 1 YD/Att 5.96 View Profile\n\nDespite suffering that injury in Week 2, Herbert played the entire game against the Panthers.

He also added 18 yards rushing on six carries.\n\nThe Chargers find themselves 2-0 heading into this Week 3 matchup against the Steelers, who also come into this head-to-head undefeated.

Built using cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques by SportsLine's Data Science team, AI Predictions and AI Ratings are generated for each game. The AI predictions are determined by statistically learning from each team's historical data and then quantitatively evaluating the strength of the opponent's defense by assigning a numeric value out of 100 called a matchup score. Once a prediction is formulated, the AI rating is generated using the prediction, the matchup score, and the odds of the market. For example, you could see an A-rating on an over bet if a team is facing a poor defense, their prediction differs from the line and there are favorable odds.

By now, most of the world's great coliseums are gone. But in the mountains of East Tennessee, one still stands and looms large over the rise and fall of its gladiators. Saturday night marks not only one of the greatest spectacles in all of NASCAR -- the Bass Pro Shops Night Race at Bristol Motor Speedway -- but also the final race of the Round of 16 and the first elimination race of the NASCAR playoffs. With only Joey Logano having advanced to the Round of 12 by virtue of his win at Atlanta, the championship fates of 15 drivers continue to hang in the balance, with four's chances at winning the 2024 Cup Series championship set to end by the end of a 500-lap race that represents the most explicit display of Saturday night short track racing there is. Time and again, Bristol has proven just how tough a racetrack it is, as it did once again in a spring race that featured extreme levels of tire wear creating an intense, edge-of-your-seat and edge-of-control affair.

From there, we move to a pair of best-of-five semifinal series and another best-of-five showdown in the Finals.

Before the action gets underway, here are CBS Sports' final power rankings of the season, the annual pre-playoffs edition.

They have been the best team in the league all season long, and finished with the best offensive rating (107.0), third-best defensive rating (95.3) and best net rating (plus-11.7). They boast an All-Star starting five led by one of the two best players in the world in Breanna Stewart and have homecourt advantage throughout the playoffs. They are the team to beat. What a season for the Lynx, who won the Commissioner's Cup championship and went 14-2 after the Olympics to grab the No. 2 seed in the playoffs.

Looking for a fresh start to his career, White signed with the Eagles following five seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. White hoped for a fresh start in Philadelphia after a rough outing in Tampa Bay, yet hasn't played through the first two games. Monday's loss was the low point. White was a healthy scratch in the loss, not being on the field when the defense collapsed in the final two minutes. Perhaps White could have helped if he was active. \"Very frustrating but it ain't the end of the world,\" White said being a healthy scratch. \"You know, when I look, turn on the tape I see a lot of good things about myself. I'm pretty sure they do too. \"So I just got keep working, you know, get better at the next thing and just keep going.\" White has handled the demotion with professionalism, which had to be a tough pill to swallow since he spent all of training camp with the first team. He's been in this situation before with the Buccaneers, making this situation easier to handle. \"I don't think I handled it the best,\" White said telling the story of his benching in Tampa Bay. \"You know, it was a lot going on that we didn't expect to go on, just far as you know, starting off asking for a trade. That wasn't like me, but I did it, you know, I had to own up to it, went to work, went to training camp, did everything right, you know, obviously getting hurt, trying to play through the injury, coming out of injury, keep playing, and then didn't play.",

The two teams were separated by only two points en route to City winning the title last season, so it's a match that despite being early in the season will have massive late season implications. Facing each other after playing to draws midweek in Champions League play won't be ideal, but that's the price of success in the Premier League. Lineups could look a little different than usual for Pep Guardiola and Mikel Arteta with Martin Odegaard ruled out of the match and Kevin De Bruyne as a game-time decision. Odegaard picked up an ankle injury on international duty for Norway while De Bruyne was withdrawn from City's midweek UCL draw against Inter with an injury. Guardiola hasn't ruled De Bruyne out of the match against Arsenal yet, but when he has missed so much time in recent seasons, it's hard to see the Belgian featuring fully if at all in the tie. No team in the Premier League has created more xG than City at 9.28, while defensively, both of these teams rank within the top five in xG against in the league, suggesting that this could be more of a defensive chess match between two managers who know each other quite well. Recent matches also back that assertion as both meetings last season only produced one goal combined. The Premier League won't be won or lost on Sunday, but in a game of psychological battles, City could deal a major blow to Arsenal's hopes. Already the last remaining team with four wins from their first four matches, extending that to five would also open a five point lead ahead of Arsenal.",

That subject came up during a recent episode of the 3 and out with John Middlekauff podcast. Gruden, who spent 17 seasons in the NFL as a head coach or assistant coach, said that Shanahan just isn't the same when he's forced to call plays while the 49ers are down. \"I'm just not a big fan of his true pass concepts when he's down,\" Gruden said. \"I just don't understand a lot of them. That's just something you have to continue to work on through OTAs, training camp and all that stuff. You have to prepare to be down. It's a lot easier to call plays when you're ahead by 14 points on first and second down.\" To Gruden's point, the 49ers had to play from behind in Week 2 against the Vikings. With the 49ers trailing 20-7 in the second half, Shanahan seemed to cut the run plays out of his playbook in favor of more drop-back passes. One reason the 49ers offense is so successful is because of the threat of the run is always there. But with that out the window, the Vikings were able to pin their ears back and go after Brock Purdy, who got sacked five times in the second half and six in the game. The 49ers tried to throw the ball on 24 of their 34 plays in the second half.",

As the Sooners prepare for their SEC debut against No. 6 Tennessee in a top-15 tilt on Saturday night, let's take a look back at their recent history against their new conference foes. Oklahoma has historically fared well against the SEC. The Sooners are 110-49-8 against current members (excluding Texas) and 24-13-3 if you remove former Big 12 rivals Texas A&M and Missouri. In the 21st century, Oklahoma has faced SEC opponents 14 times with an 8-6 record. However, that record contains some devastating losses in the BCS Championship Game and the College Football Playoff.

Jan. 1, 2002: No. 10 Oklahoma 10, Arkansas 3\n\nThis Cotton Bowl was the epitome of a defensive slugfest; both teams struggled to move the ball. The Sooners were able to move it a little more than the Razorbacks, though, and the difference was a Nate Hybl QB sneak touchdown. Defensively, All-American Roy Williams was all over the field for Oklahoma and completely stifled the Arkansas offense. Sept. 7, 2002: No. 2 Oklahoma 37, Alabama 27\n\nThe unranked Crimson Tide came into Norman and gave the Sooners a dogfight. Oklahoma went into halftime with a 23-2 lead, but Alabama responded with 24 straight points to take a fourth-quarter lead. The Sooners steadied themselves in front of the home crowd and scored the final two touchdowns for the win.",

        "text": "The New York Jets may have found a steal in the fourth round of the 2024 NFL Draft when they selected former Wisconsin running back Braelon Allen with the No. 134 overall pick. Despite being one of the youngest players in the entire class and possessing excellent size at 6-foot-1, 235 pounds, there were nine running backs selected over him. In his first three NFL games, Allen has rushed 19 times for 96 yards and a touchdown, and caught six passes for 45 yards and another score. While the Jets have a superstar in the backfield with Breece Hall, New York's staff has already deemed the 20-year-old Allen worthy of some touches in Aaron Rodgers' offense. How did Allen fall to the fourth round in this past draft? It was a question being asked on social media. Allen took time to answer that question Friday, and he blamed the amount of importance placed on the NFL Combine, or \"Underwear Olympics.\" \"Everyone wanted to see me run in my underwear to decide if I was a good football player,\" Allen wrote. Allen did attend this year's combine, but did not participate in every drill. For example, he did not run the 40-yard dash -- a drill which fans and pundits give too much attention to. In the Week 2 victory over the Tennessee Titans, Allen recorded 56 total yards and two total touchdowns. He became the youngest NFL player to score a touchdown since Arnie Herber in 1930 (both 20 years, 239 days old), and the youngest player in NFL history to score multiple touchdowns in a contest.",

A decade ago, a meeting like this was just an idea. \"Lesley [Visser] and I used to talk, amongst others,\" Andrea Kremer, the Emmy award winning sports journalist said. \"We always talked about sports. We would talk all the time about: Why isn't there The View for sports?\" That was the foundation for the idea that eventually became We Need to Talk, CBS Sports' first-of-its-kind all-female sports talk show now celebrating its 10th year with an episode at 1:30 p.m. ET Saturday on CBS. It was a long-gestating project pitched primarily by Visser, a trailblazing sports journalist, and director Suzanne Smith that took multiple iterations -- and faced multiple rejections long for various reasons before its first episode aired a decade ago. The show found a home with CBS Sports, where a well-rounded vision was executed in a way few women-centric ventures in sports have. The women who create the show on a regular basis were also included in its formation from the start -- Smith said she was in meetings that directors do not usually attend, and name-dropped ex-tennis professional and executive Katrina Adams as a fellow attendee. The collaboration paved the way for a show that is not just hosted exclusively by women but is stitched together by an all-female control room, a regular feature rather than the one-off that remains the industry standard. We Need to Talk tapings are an all-star assembly of female broadcasters, essential to create a quality program as well as ensure a first-of-its-kind program would have any longevity.",

Manning entered the game in the second quarter following an injury to Quinn Ewers, and it didn't take long for him to make his impression. On his first play from scrimmage, Manning hit DeAndre Moore for a 19-yard touchdown, and the crowd at Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium got an extended look at the future. Manning finished the evening with 223 yards and four touchdowns on 9-for-12 passing, and he showed off his speed on a 67-yard rushing touchdown. The win vaulted Texas to No. 1 in the nation in this week's Associated Press Top 25 poll as Steve Sarkisian continues to build Texas into a national title contender. In many ways, landing Arch Manning was a sign that things had changed in Austin after a decade of mediocrity. When Manning arrived as a high school freshman at Isidore Newman School in New Orleans, he instantly became one of the most high-profile recruits in the country. Manning and his family kept their recruiting plans quiet during his first two years, but several schools emerged as favorites the following spring. Alabama, Ole Miss, Clemson, Georgia, and Texas were among the programs said to be favored by the family. While Texas seemed like it would be on the outside looking in initially, it became clear that Texas was a serious contender. A big reason for that was the presence of Steve Sarkisian. While at Alabama, Sarkisian's offensive innovation and quarterback development were among the best in the country. Manning already had a childhood fondness for Texas, but the chance to play for Sarkisian put them in a prime position.",

        "text": "Daniel Ricciardo’s shocking mid-season return to the Formula 1 grid a year ago had the makings of the latest dream ending in the sport. But as the grid arrived in Singapore for this weekend’s Singapore Grand Prix, that dream ending seems to have the feeling of a last stand. Recent developments around him, as well as the driver’s inconsistent form, have seen that dream take on more of a nightmare feeling. And while this weekend marks his return to the Singapore Grand Prix, a race he missed last year due to injury, there is a thought that his time at Visa Cash App RB F1 Team — and potentially in the sport itself — could be drawing to a close. Ricciardo’s surprise return to the grid a season ago, replacing the struggling Nyck de Vries at AlphaTauri, was welcomed throughout the paddock by journalists and Netflix producers alike. While Max Verstappen and Red Bull were running away with the Drivers’ and Constructors’ Championships, respectively, the return of the supremely marketable Ricciardo offered something of a spark. But that return was derailed by a practice crash at the Dutch Grand Prix that resulted in a broken bone in his left hand, and Ricciardo’s subsequent surgery sidelined him for several races. That handed an opportunity to reserve driver Liam Lawson who capitalized on his chance with several impressive performances, including a ninth-place finish at the Singapore Grand Prix. At that point in the season, Lawson’s P9 was the team’s best result of the year. Of course, Ricciardo returned to the grid and delivered a command performance of his own, capitalizing on a strong qualifying run — and a slipstream from teammate Yuki Tsunoda in both Q1 and Q2 — to qualify fourth at the Mexico City Grand Prix.",

Despite some consternation from rival teams, the sport’s governing body issued a statement ahead of the Singapore Grand Prix that the rear wing was legal. However, they indicated they would monitor the issue, prompting many to wonder if clarifications would follow before the United States Grand Prix. It seems we do not need to wait that long. According to multiple reports such as this one from Motorsport, the FIA has requested that McLaren modify the rear wing so it will no longer flex under aerodynamic load. As video footage from the Azerbaijan Grand Prix noted, when the MCL38 was under aerodynamic load — such as at high speeds on longer straights — the rear wing would flex, creating a gap many termed a “mini-DRS.”\n\nYou can see that in action on this angle from the Azerbaijan Grand Prix. As Oscar Piastri hits high speeds the rear wing flexes, creating a gap that allows for increased airflow through the rear wing, similar to what you see when DRS is activated and the rear wing is opened:\n\nI'll leave this here @ScuderiaFerrari @FIA\n\n\n\nThe entire DRS flap is rotating under load. You can see at the pivot points, the flap is not aligning with the wing tips. The flap is backing off at high speed, shedding drag. How is this okay? pic.twitter.com/OL5IijqnJV — B (@brakeboosted) September 15, 2024\n\nIt is important to note, as pointed out by Terry Widdows, that the rear wing McLaren is using in Singapore this weekend for the Singapore Grand Prix is not the exact configuration they used in Baku.",

Arizona Cardinals over Detroit Lions - Mark Schofield\n\nAfter a season-opening loss to the Buffalo Bills, the Arizona Cardinals rebounded in their home opener with a 41-10 thrashing of the banged up Los Angeles Rams. Marvin Harrison Jr. looked like the wide receiver that was promised, Kyler Murray was running around in and outside the pocket in a vintage performance, and James Conner added 122 yards and a touchdown on the ground. Now they get the Detroit Lions coming to town, and while odds might favor Arizona, the Lions have not looked flawless over two games. Sure they won back in Week 1, but they needed overtime to beat the Rams at home. Is Arizona for real? I believe so, and I think this is the week we find out for sure. Jacksonville Jaguars over Buffalo Bills - Matt Warren\n\nListen, I know the Bills have looked very good and the Jaguars have, well, not.

In the wake of Oscar Piastri’s dramatic win in the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, video footage surfaced showing how the rear wing of McLaren’s MCL38 would “flex” under high aerodynamic load, such as you would see on a long straight at high speeds. Then in curves, the rear wing would revert to form, allowing for more downforce through turns.

In sum, the PGA of America ruled that LIV Golf stars, such as Brooks Koepka and Bryson DeChambeau, are eligible for the 2025 Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black, the 2025 PGA Championship at Quail Hollow in Charlotte, and each future iteration of those events “going forward.”\n\nThe complete statement from the PGA of America follows below:\n\nTo ensure the PGA Championship will contiunue to deliver the strongest field in golf and that the U.S. Ryder Cup team will continue to have access to the best American players, the PGA of America board has determined that LIV Golf players will be eligbile for both. Going forward, all LIV Golf players are eligibile for the PGA Championship and any American player who qualifies for the Ryder Cup on points or is added to the U.S. team as a captain’s pick is eligbile to compete. This is consistent with LIV Golf players competiting in the PGA Championship the past two years. Brooks Koepka was a member of the U.S. Ryder Cup team last year. As the last stanza points out, this statement is consistent with how the organization has handled the rise of LIV Golf. Plenty of major champions play on the Saudi-backed circuit, and Koepka even took home the Wanamaker Trophy at Oak Hill in May 2023. In doing so, he became the first active LIV player to win a major. Fifteen other LIV players teed it up at Oak Hill, too. But then the PGA of America doubled down on this policy, inviting 16 total players to play at Valhalla this year.",

        "text": "The early weeks of the 2024 season have generated some unexpected headlines. In many cases, the underlying stories aren’t going away. In Cleveland, quarterback Deshaun Watson faces both a new lawsuit and fresh league discipline after being accused of sexual assault and battery in a complaint filed on September 9. There’s no specific news for now. However, there’s chatter in league circles regarding a potential suspension under the Personal Conduct Policy. The league has said Watson won’t be placed on paid leave. The lawyer for the new accuser has said she will cooperate with the league’s investigation. The neutral party who conducts the disciplinary hearings, Judge Sue Robinson, concluded two years ago that Watson’s flat denial of any and all suggestions of wrongdoing lacked credibility. If she handles this case, too, she might be inclined to give greater weight to the new accuser’s version of events, if only because she has already decided that Watson is not a fully reliable witness. The question becomes how quickly events will proceed. Will the league feel compelled to expedite the situation, resolving it during the 2024 season? Or will the league be content to wait to proceed in the offseason? Regardless, there are indications the Browns are preparing for the possibility that a suspension will be pursued, and obtained, this season. Some believe they’re evaluating available quarterbacks, even though they currently have both Jameis Winston and Dorian Thompson-Robinson on the roster. On one hand, any suspension gives the Browns a potential avenue for voiding the remaining guarantees in Watson’s deal, if he did not previously disclose this claim to the team.",

It was the first time in 12 years that Chelsea had walked out without Emma Hayes in the dugout, but the Blues were pushed the entire way by a talented Villa side, themselves with new manager Robert de Pauw. The hosts could have gone ahead early on as Guro Reiten twice fired wide. Missy-Bo Kearns had Aston Villa's best chance too, but could only divert over the crossbar from close range. And with less than 10 minutes of the half to play, Chelsea took the lead. Rytting Kaneryd chopped past Paula Tomas and sent a superb curling effort past Sabrina D'Angelo. The second half was end-to-end, as Aston Villa rightly sensed the chance to take a point away from Kingsmeadow. Hannah Hampton needed to make two world-class saves in added time too, keeping out headers from Rachel Daly and then, incredibly, her opposite number D'Angelo to keep Chelsea's lead intact.

Last season's 4-0 loss at Selhurst Park highlighted the defensive openness Ugarte has been brought in to fix. United were beset by injuries that day, forced to use Jonny Evans and Casemiro at centre-back. But their defensive struggles have been a consistent theme. Casemiro continues to attract criticism for his displays at the base of midfield. He was dropped against Southampton following his error-strewn showing in the 3-0 loss to Liverpool before the international break. But the issues are not just down to personnel. Their approach under Erik ten Hag, which involves his full-backs pushing high up the pitch on both flanks in possession, remains deeply problematic in a defensive sense, with Arne Slot's Liverpool the latest side to profit from their vulnerability in transition.",

Instead the question should be: Why is he the youngest top-flight coach in history? The 31-year-old's start to life in English football with Brighton has been impressive. Six games, zero defeats, undefeated against Arsenal and Manchester United and clean sheets in half their matches so far. Hurzeler sits down with Sky Sports and question one is about what rating he would give his side out of 10 so far. He jokes that, with data-driven owner Tony Bloom at the helm, he already has those numbers to hand. \"Maybe we're at seven, maybe six?,\" he says. \"The top of the middle, I would say. \"I wouldn't say that we are already a top team. Of course it should be our ambition and our goal, but we have to work hard for this. \"Of course, there are still lots of improvements we can do and we will try to work on it. But, on the other side, we should be positive and say 'things already work'.\" So what is working for Hurzeler? What is currently on show that justifies Brighton going for a young second division manager from Germany. This journalist ran through the tactical elements of Hurzeler's Brighton with the manager himself - and the insight is fascinating. 'I don't like formations' - so are midfielders playing up front? Hurzeler arrived at Brighton with next to no reputation at the highest level of the game - but those who watched the German at St Pauli referred to him and his tactics as 'quirky'.",

        "text": "\"Laser. Laser focus,\" said Marc Skinner, after Manchester United rounded off their pre-season campaign with a less-than-perfect 1-0 defeat to Tottenham. \"We were a bit sluggish and that cannot happen,\" he added. 'Same but different' is the mantra for the new term, as Skinner attempts to navigate the loss of some of United's most well-known and well-respected players, while improving on last year's underwhelming fifth-place finish. Incomings have been shrewd, which will mitigate some of the fallout, but Skinner's biggest assignment this season will concern the cloud that has engulfed Carrington over the past 12 months, and how to lift it. No easy task - it's consistently overcast in Manchester. Image: Mary Earps left Man Utd in pursuit of silverware this summer, joining PSG on a free transfer\n\nThe so-called 'summer of discontent', which saw Mary Earps and Katie Zelem leave, among others, and raised issues over temporary training facilities as well as where the team ranks in the overall priorities of the club's new ownership group, has made for interesting discussion. Skinner has heard most of it before. The former Birmingham City and Orlando Pride boss is no stranger to criticism, and has had to field questions - or \"noise\", as he terms it - about the wider structure and governance of the club since his appointment back in 2021. But the noise was louder than it ever has been last season, in part because results on the pitch were less than convincing and it felt as if performance had regressed. Whispers of dissatisfaction were getting harder to ignore.",

        "text": "The human brain is hardwired to resist change, and status quo bias is one of the strongest logical fallacies that affects our daily lives. From 1992 until this year, European soccer fans watched the best teams on the continent compete in midweek round-robin group play. It was fun. It was comfortable. And it often provided us with a singular “group of death” almost every year that saw multiple top teams pitted against one another. The Champions League format was inherently simple—teams were placed into pots based on past European success and drawn into groups of four teams. After six matches, the top two teams from each group would qualify for the knockout round. A series of two-legged aggregate playoffs would narrow down the field to the final two teams, who would then meet in the final at a neutral site to determine European soccer superiority and conclude the club season. The old Champions League format had the history, the pageantry, and the iconic anthem. A sport steeped in tradition where fans dreamed about traveling abroad for away nights across Europe. A tune that echoed throughout the grounds and into neighboring cities around Europe before kickoff. Why change it? The better question to ask is, why not change it? I might always want my favorite dish at my favorite restaurant, but it’s past time for the Champions League to try a new dish. The fear of the unknown is one thing, but the Champions League is going to maintain so much of what we all love about it in the new format. Instead of romanticizing the past, let’s acknowledge that we’re keeping the best of the Champions League knockout stage and improving the group stage so that it’s a more essential watch.",

A case in point this week came from the relatively correct aggregation of an on-TV report from Fox Sports’ Jay Glazer, who later took to X/Twitter to say he misspoke. Here’s how the “Dov Kleiman” account handled it. The #Browns removed a clause from Deshaun Watson’s contract this offseason that would protect him in the event of a future suspension, per @JayGlazer If Watson is suspended again, Cleveland could reclaim his guaranteed money. pic.twitter.com/9yAYeTarLo — Dov Kleiman (@NFL_DovKleiman) September 15, 2024\n\nHere’s what Glazer said later:\n\nI Think i screwed up how I explained Watson’s contract this AM.

MY bad.” And that’s a fair apology from Glazer and a notable change to the story; that means that the Browns didn’t actually remove this clause at all, just that it wasn’t included in the revised one (but hadn’t been included in the original one beyond 2022-23 so that’s no change).",

It was nearly impossible to imagine anyone (save for Wojnarowski’s protege Shams Charania) filling the considerable shoes in a role Wojnarowski basically invented when he announced his retirement this week. Two new reports suggest the worldwide leader either believes nobody can do it or that the juice isn’t worth the squeeze any longer. On Friday, John Ourand at Puck wrote that his sources believe “ESPN doesn’t need a Woj 2.0 and can break NBA news by committee with their deep roster of NBA reporting talent.” That backs up earlier reporting from Michael McCarthy at Front Office Sports that “Wojnarowski’s departure could pave the way” for longtime ESPNer Brian Windhorst to take on a larger role at the network along with other existing NBA reporters who are better on television than Wojnarowski was. The economics of the insider have always been uncertain at ESPN, particularly on the NBA side. Wojnarowski did not maintain a regular role on NBA Today, let alone signature shows First Take or The Pat McAfee Show, effectively making Charania its own NBA insider since joining ESPN last year. Wojnarowski was more selective with where he appeared. Most of his hits came on SportsCenter and ESPN’s game and event broadcasts. Those appearances, combined with social media hits and the occasional feature story, likely had difficulty generating enough revenue to offset Wojnarowski’s significant salary. Certainly, Windhorst can hold his own with McAfee or Stephen A. Smith better than Wojnarowski could. Others like Ramona Shelburne are far more prolific on television, including Around the Horn and NBA Today.",

Hosted by veteran sports journalists Steven Godfrey and Ryan Nanni, Who Killed College Football? is a six-part podcast series that explores the dramatic transformation of America’s beloved sport. According to a release, the show will use storytelling and interviews to uncover the motivations, history, and potential culprits behind the significant changes that have reshaped college football for both better and worse. A preview is currently available on Spotify:\n\n“We wanted to tell a more layered, complex story and pick apart the convenient answers to why college football is changing – ‘the players are selfish,’ ‘the TV networks control everything,’ ‘the schools are cheating.’ Who Killed College Football? not only explains how we got here but helps the listener see where we might wind up going,” said Godfrey in a release. Nanni added, “Who Killed College Football? will distill the sport’s decades of corruption, stubbornness, and darkly comic dysfunction for not only listeners who love/hate college football, but anyone who appreciates an absurd, tragic, maddening, and fascinating tale.”\n\nThe podcast will consist of six 70-minute episodes, released biweekly throughout the college football season.

A national broadcast package could offer fans more access to their favorite teams, potentially eliminating blackout restrictions and offering a more streamlined viewing experience. At the same time, the league’s exploration of a national broadcast package reflects a broader trend in sports media, with leagues and teams increasingly looking to capitalize on the growth of streaming services. But in capitalizing on the growth and attempting to grow the game, the league risks alienating its fans. You see, there’s a deep-rooted connection between fans of their favorite team and their local broadcast. It’s an unbreakable bond, one that the league keeps trying to test. That will be on full display this weekend. While moving away from local broadcasts in favor of a national model certainly has its appeal, there are also certain drawbacks. Some drawbacks are more tangible than others, but it’s worth noting that a weekend series between the New York Mets and Philadelphia Series underscores just how important local broadcasts are to a local fanbase. This weekend, Major League Baseball has robbed Mets fans of hearing their beloved play-by-play announcer Gary Cohen and analysts Ron Darling and Keith Hernandez. Awful Announcing’s readers ranked it the No. 1 broadcast booth in the sport for a reason, and with the Mets in the crux of a pennant race, MLB has delivered a big middle finger to the Mets and its fans.",

That much has been proven time and time and time again ever since the Saudi-funded breakaway tour fractured professional golf. LIV Golf held their season ending championship event this past weekend, won by $350 million man Jon Rahm. And once again, very few people tuned in to watch. LIV drew a microscopic 89,000 viewers on the CW up against the NFL. In fact, they were far from the most watched golf event on Sunday. That honor went to the Solheim Cup, which drew over 7x the viewership at 657,000 viewers. So naturally, Chamblee took the opportunity to pull out the big stick and take another swing at LIV, saying it “remains in the witness protection program of sports viewership.”\n\nDespite billions of dollars for golf megastars, LIV remains in the witness protection program of sports viewership.

If LIV is in the witness protection program, the PGA Tour’s Fall series may have faked its own death. Of course, several caveats exist in that the Fall series isn’t part of the regular PGA Tour calendar that ends with the Tour Championship and featured a leaderboard full of names that might be foreign to even the most dedicated golf fans.",

The world champion made his remarks during Thursday’s official media gathering when he was asked about why team-mate Sergio Perez had been quicker than him in Azerbaijan last weekend. Verstappen responded: “I don’t know, man. Different set-up. So as soon as I went into qualifying, I knew the car was f*****.” […] The investigation found Verstappen in breach of the regulations, the stewards’ report read: “It is the policy of the FIA to ensure that language used in its public forums, such as press conferences, meets generally accepted standards for all audiences and broadcasts. In particular this is true of statements made by participants in the World Championships and thus being role models both inside and outside the sport.",

While the legendary voice who retired earlier this season will return to call the playoffs for WFAN this fall, the radio giant still hasn’t landed on who will be his successor.\n\nIt was reported earlier this week that Seattle Mariners TV play-by-play voice Dave Sims had interviewed for the position. Replacing Sterling would be a full circle moment for the 71-year-old Sims, who got his start at the New York Daily News, before venturing into radio, hosting a midday show on WFAN with Ed Coleman from 1989-93. He also was a weekend sports anchor at WCBS-TV in New York, as well as a radio host for the New York Knicks.\n\nSims has worn many hats, but has yet to wear a Yankees cap. Perhaps that’s in the cards, but he’s not the only candidate to replace Sterling. On Friday, the New York Post reported that in addition to Sims, the other finalist is Rickie Ricardo, who has been part of a rotating contingent that’s filled in for Sterling alongside Suzyn Waldman this season.\n\nRyan Glasspiegel’s reporting narrows down the race to be Sims and Ricardo, but he also notes that Marlins announcer Paul Severino had some initial discussions with the Bronx Bombers, but is not among the finalists to be the Yankees’ radio voice.\n\nAs for Ricardo, the longtime Spanish language announcer made his statement to WFAN and New York Yankees fans everywhere that he should be the one to take the torch from Sterling earlier this season, with an incredible Jazz Chisholm Jr. home run call.\n\nWhether that — and his experience working with Waldman — gives him the edge over Sims remains to be seen.\n\n[NY Post]",

The visitors, representing Oceania, boast a strong pedigree as three-time consecutive OFC Champions League winners, although they enter this match following a disappointing Chatham Cup final loss to Wellington Olympic. Match preview\n\n© Imago\n\nAl Ain, one of the UAE's most prominent football clubs, enter the 2024 FIFA Intercontinental Cup with a strong international pedigree, highlighted by their 2023-24 AFC Champions League triumph, which secured their spot in this tournament, and though they have not won the UAE Pro League since 2021-22, they remain competitive domestically with recent runner-up finishes in both the league and League Cup. The hosts, drawing inspiration from that historic 2018 Club World Cup run where they defeated Team Wellington, Esperance de Tunis and River Plate en route to the final against Real Madrid, are now poised to replicate that success in the 2024 Intercontinental Cup, beginning with this fixture. Under the guidance of Argentine football legend Hernan Crespo, Al Zaeem have made a strong start to the 2024-25 season, remaining unbeaten in five matches across all competitions.

Brest return to domestic matters after a historic midweek win when they host Toulouse at the Stade Francis-Le Ble on Sunday. On their Champions League debut on Thursday, Brest recorded a 2-1 win over Sturm Graz, sparking jubilant scenes despite playing in Guingamp, over an hour away from their home venue. Match preview\n\n© Imago\n\nFor the first time in a generation, Brest took to the field in a European fixture in midweek, and it just so happened to be in the Champions League, and they took all three points against the Austrian champions. It is still remarkable how a club who slipped out of the professional leagues entirely for 15 years, and had not finished in the top half of Ligue 1 since 1990, managed to finish third last season, but they have now given themselves an incredible opportunity to reach the knockout stage. Brest were fully deserving of their three points too, as Abdallah Sima scored the winner after an unfortunate Edmilson Fernandes own goal had cancelled out Hugo Magnetti's opener. Had it not been for Sima's fellow Brighton & Hove Albion loanee Kjell Scherpen in the Sturm goal, Brest could have been out of sight late on, but Eric Roy's side held on for the 2-1 win. That could be the catalyst to kickstart Brest's season, as they enter the weekend with just three points from their opening four games. Following on from last season's heroics was always going to be difficult, and Roy must ensure he can keep his side focused on domestic matters in the midst of some huge fixtures in Europe.",

Against Ajax last time out, Fortuna were already two goals down before Rodrigo Guth was sent for an early shower, and de Godenzonen made the most of their man advantage, adding another three to their tally in the second half. With that, Danny Buijs's side have now gone just shy of 300 minutes without scoring a league goal since Josip Mitrovic's strike against De Zwarte Schapen over a month ago, which was also their last goal on their home patch.

Adi Hutter's in-form, confident Monaco side welcome Le Havre to the Stade Louis II for a Ligue 1 clash on Sunday afternoon. Monaco enter the fixture on the back of an excellent Champions League win over Barcelona in the week, marking their return to competition with three points after six years away. Match preview\n\n© Imago\n\nIn what was largely a fine week for French clubs in the Champions League, with three of their four representatives winning, Monaco's success was arguably the most eye-catching of any result across the competition. An early red card to Barca's Eric Garcia helped, but ending their 100% start to the season was a real scalp for Hutter's Monaco, who have made a superb start to the campaign themselves. Two attackers with a combined age of just 40 scored the two goals for Monaco, with George Ilenikhena netting the winner after Lamine Yamal had cancelled out Maghnes Akliouche's opener in what was a night for the young talent on display. The fact that Eliesse Ben Seghir and Lamine Camara both starred in the Monaco XI shows what an exciting youthful squad Hutter has at his disposal. Thursday's win extended their unbeaten start across all competition to five matches, four of which have ended in victory, after recording a 3-0 win over Auxerre in their last league outing.

These two sides are part of the seven teams in the league currently on six points, though Feyenoord have played a game less than most around them barring Ajax. Match preview\n\n© Imago\n\nFeyenoord have not made the type of start to the 2024-25 Eredivisie season that they would have been expecting, having only managed a single victory across their first four games of the new campaign. That win came against PEC Zwolle in gameweek two, while their remaining three fixtures have all ended level, with the side drawing 1-1 against Willem II and Sparta Rotterdam before a 2-2 draw with Groningen last weekend. All of those results came before the Pride of South's opening-round clash with Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League, which they lost very poorly, with the reigning Bundesliga champions putting the game to bed by the halftime interval. Xabi Alonso's men rattled in four goals in the first 45, and while Brian Priske's side had marginally more possession and more attempts at goal, they never really looked likely to get themselves back in the tie.

Match preview\n\n© Imago\n\nComing into the new season as the favourites to be instantly relegated back to Ligue 2, Angers have done little to convince football fans otherwise in the opening month of the campaign. Alexandre Dujeux's side have been hugely disappointing so far, taking just one point from their opening four games, with goal difference the only thing keeping them off the foot of the table at present. Their solitary point came last weekend, ending their 100% losing start to the season, holding Strasbourg to a 1-1 draw on the road, as striker Bamba Dieng scored the club's first open-play goal since returning to the top flight. Angers' relegation in 2022-23 was largely down to their woeful home form, and little seems to have changed, with two defeats to start, extending a run of 13 losses in their last 17 Ligue 1 games at the Raymond-Kopa. Leaking goals is the glaring issue, as Angers have conceded over two goals-per-game in their previous 20 home matches, and already let in eight in four across all venues this season.

The Gunners successfully negotiated the first round with wins over Rangers and Rosenborg, but the second stage is proving to be a little trickier. Arsenal fell to a narrow 1-0 defeat in the away leg of their qualifying tie with Swedish side Hacken, leaving them with work to do in the return leg on Thursday. Before they play host to Hacken, Arsenal will attempt to extend their unbeaten WSL run to seven matches in Sunday's opener. Meanwhile, Man City are still searching for their second league title after they fell agonisingly short in their bid to achieve WSL glory. Gareth Taylor's side ultimately lost out to Chelsea on goal difference after two title protagonists finished level on 55 points. While they would have been disappointed to miss out on the WSL title, Man City's second-place finish did at least secure them a spot in the second round of Women's Champions League qualifying.",

Real Madrid have reportedly highlighted Real Sociedad's Martin Zubimendi as a strong alternative to Rodri, should they miss out on a move for the Manchester City man. Zubimendi was a Euro 2024 winner with Spain over the summer, replacing an injured Rodri at half time in the final against England. The 25-year-old has spent his entire career at Real Sociedad, and turned down a move to Liverpool over the summer due to his love for the club where he broke through as a youngster. However, the lure of Real Madrid is like no other, as the current Champions League holders have been able to pluck any player they want in recent years, such as Kylian Mbappe and Jude Bellingham. Man City's Rodri is the number one target to add to their midfield, but the financial backing behind the Premier League champions and the success they achieve could be a significant stumbling block. Rodri seamlessly slotted back into the Man City midfield in their 0-0 draw with Inter Milan on Wednesday, making his first club start of the new campaign, as the Citizens look to wrestle back the Champions League trophy away from Real Madrid this season. © Imago\n\nCould Real miss out on both Rodri and Zubimendi? Transfer expert Ekrem Konur claims that Zubimendi is high on the club's shortlist of options should they fail in their pursuit of Rodri. While luring Rodri away from the winning juggernaut that is Manchester City, Zubimendi appears on paper to be an easier target to prise away from his current employers, despite his strong local links at La Real.",

Athletic Bilbao will be aiming to make it three straight La Liga victories when they welcome Celta Vigo to San Mames on Sunday afternoon.

Match preview\n\n© Imago\n\nAthletic had a slow start to the season, being held at home by Getafe in their campaign opener before suffering a 2-1 defeat to Barcelona, but they managed to record a 1-0 victory over Valencia at the end of August. A second defeat in three matches followed at home to Atletico Madrid, but the Lions have been victorious in their last two games, winning a five-goal thriller against Las Palmas last weekend before beating Leganes 2-0 on Thursday night courtesy of goals from Dani Vivian and Inaki Williams.

Having made their worst start to a season since 2018, AC Milan will try to halt Inter Milan's six-game winning streak in the Derby della Madonnina when the two teams convene at San Siro on Sunday evening. The Milan derby comes amid speculation about Paulo Fonseca's position as the Rossoneri's manager, so the stakes will be particularly high when selecting his starting XI to face the Italian champions. After being substituted during Tuesday's 3-1 Champions League defeat to Liverpool, goalkeeper Mike Maignan faces a race against time to overcome a knee injury - believed to be bruising - and Fonseca may have to field a 19-year-old rookie if the Frenchman is not passed fit. Experienced back-up Marco Sportiello has been sidelined for several weeks, so teenager Lorenzo Torriani could be pitched into a must-win derby, having played most of the second half in midweek. Elsewhere, Milan will be without Ismael Bennacer (ankle), Alessandro Florenzi (ACL) and Malick Thiaw (ankle), but that would not stop Fonseca potentially naming an unchanged XI, notwithstanding Maignan's possible absence. However, one change could come in defence, where Emerson Royal and Davide Calabria continue to battle it out for the problem right-back position. Although alternatives such as Noah Okafor, Samu Chukwueze and Tammy Abraham are available, the Rossoneri's attacking triumvirate should again feature Alvaro Morata, Christian Pulisic and Rafael Leao. The latter has a point to prove this weekend, as across the past 15 derbies he has been on the winning side just three times - losing 10 - while making only five goal contributions.",

Newcastle United have reportedly tabled a new contract offer in front of Anthony Gordon in the hope of fighting off interest from Liverpool for the young winger. Gordon was the subject of transfer speculation over the summer, with a move in the region of £75m being touted for the 23-year-old. PSR constraints meant that Newcastle had to sell some assets to avoid being punished by the Premier League's financial rules, but they managed to hold on to their biggest talents, such as Gordon, and also Alexander Isak and Bruno Guimaraes. Instead, deals were struck that saw Yankuba Minteh and Elliot Anderson leave St. James' Park, in what was overall a quiet summer on Tyneside. © Imago\n\nLiverpool suffer blow in Gordon pursuit? Any hopes Liverpool had of resurrecting a deal for Gordon in January or next summer could hit a stumbling block though, as Gordon is set to be offered a bumper new deal at Newcastle. The Daily Mail claim that the Magpies are prepared to make Gordon the highest-paid player at the club to fend off interest from Liverpool and any other parties who may come in for the England international. Having started all four Premier League games so far this season, on the back of a campaign which saw Gordon hit double figures for goals and assists, Newcastle evidently feel the need to quickly tie down one of their most prized assets. Gordon started both of England's UEFA Nations League wins earlier this month, raising his profile further after being largely overlooked by Gareth Southgate at the Euros in the summer.",

Aston Villa head coach Unai Emery has admitted that Jhon Duran is \"close\" to making his first start of the season. After a summer of speculation regarding his future, it came as no surprise when the forward began the opening Premier League fixture of 2024-25 against West Ham United on the substitutes' bench. However, as well as netting the winner in that game, Duran has since repeated the trick against Leicester City and Everton, equalling Premier League history in the process. For a fifth game in succession, the Colombia international was only named as a replacement for Tuesday's Champions League encounter at Swiss side Young Boys. Although he had a goal disallowed, the 20-year-old again made a positive impact having replaced Ollie Watkins shortly after the hour mark. © Imago\n\nCould Duran start against Wolves?

Nevertheless, speaking to reporters at a press conference, Emery has hinted that it is not a foregone conclusion that Duran will finally feature from the opening whistle.

Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has said that he does not agree with Rodri's comments about Arsenal lacking the mentality to win at the Etihad Stadium.

After the highly-anticipated Anthony Joshua and Daniel Dubois fight, the Etihad Stadium hosts another heavyweight contest this weekend, as Manchester City and Arsenal scrap for Premier League supremacy. Pep Guardiola reunites with former student Mikel Arteta on the back of last season's epic top-flight title battle, where the Gunners pushed their Mancunian counterparts all the way before falling excruciatingly short on the final day. After losing the crown to City by two points last year, Arsenal coincidentally already have an identical gap to make up to the champions this time around, having won three and drawn one of their opening four contests to reside in the familiar runners-up spot. Meanwhile, the reigning champions are the only Premier League side still boasting a 100% domestic record in 2024-25, although they were stunted in a goalless Champions League draw with Inter Milan in midweek, as were Arsenal against Atalanta BC. While some of the league's finest talents will strut their stuff at the Etihad, two influential figures could be missing through injury, and here, Sports Mole selects a combined XI from both squads, using only players expected to be available for the match. Just when David Raya appeared to make the best save he would conjure up all season against Aston Villa, the Arsenal number one produced an even more breathtaking stop - or pair of stops - in the draw with Atalanta, which Arteta unsurprisingly hailed as one of the best he has ever seen in his career.

Lyon host Marseille in the first Derby des Olympiques of the season in Ligue 1 on Sunday night. The visitors have made a strong start under Roberto De Zerbi, while Lyon are lingering down in the bottom half similarly to how they started last season. Match preview\n\n© Imago\n\nInitially a derby that had no bad blood attached to it, this is a fixture that has turned ugly in recent years, and no Marseille away fans will be present due to incidents that have occurred in recent years. Marseille's Dimitri Payet and former Lyon boss Fabio Grosso have both been struck with objects in fixtures over the past two years leading to postponements and the game being played behind closed doors. That means there will be no Marseille fans here to see whether their side can make it back-to-back wins at the Groupama Stadium, after ending a 17-game winless streak in Lyon last season. Malo Gusto's comical late own goal gifted OM a late 2-1 win in a city where they had endured a torrid run, but they will come into this as clear favourites despite their historically bad record. Their status as favourites is largely down to the fact they have started the season four games unbeaten for the fourth year in a row, after a 2-0 win over Nice last weekend. De Zerbi's side sit in second only behind a Paris Saint-Germain side who have made a 100% start, but who will have European distractions throughout the season, unlike Marseille. As is the case with De Zerbi's teams, the mantra has been based on an attack-first mentality, and that has seen Marseille score 12 goals in their first four games of the season.",

Scottish Premiership leaders Celtic are set to take on Scottish Championship leaders Falkirk on Sunday in the quarter-final of the 2024-25 Scottish League Cup. The hosts beat Hibernian 3-1 to progress to this stage, while the visitors dispatched Hearts 2-0 in their second-round tie to set up this quarter-final. Match preview\n\n© Imago\n\nCeltic's start to the 2024-25 campaign perfectly reflects their recent dominance in Scottish football, as they have won all seven of their opening matches across all competitions. Aside from a second-placed finish behind an undefeated Rangers team in 2020-21, the Bhoys have claimed 12 of the last 13 Scottish Premiership titles, as well as accumulating a total of 14 trophies from both the Scottish Cup and the Scottish League Cup during that period. Brendan Rodgers, who returned to the side in July 2023 after departing for Leicester City in February 2019, will be looking to lift the first available trophy of the season with the Scottish League Cup final taking place in December, and he will fancy his side's chances of progressing given their perfect start to the campaign. Not only have they won all seven of their opening fixtures, but they have conceded just twice while scoring an impressive 22 goals, including five in a historic 5-1 victory against Slovan Bratislava in their most recent Champions League match. Celtic will undoubtedly be heavy favourites for a comfortable victory against Falkirk on Sunday, and history is also in their favour with the Championship side failing to record a victory against the Bhoys in any of their last nine meetings, with seven defeats and two draws.",

Chelsea have reportedly decided against loaning out Estevao Willian when he joins the club next summer. The Blues have made an effort to recruit up-and-coming talents since Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital completed their takeover of the club in 2022. Chelsea's hierarchy are hoping that Estevao is one of the names that will develop into a star after they struck a deal in June to him from Palmeiras in the summer of 2025. The Premier League club reached an agreement with Palmeiras over a deal worth up to £51m to sign a player nicknamed 'Messinho' due to his impressive dribbling skills. While he may still be with Palmeiras, there are questions as to whether he will be loaned out or integrated into Chelsea's first-team squad when he arrives in England next year. © Reuters\n\nChelsea make Estevao loan decision\n\nAccording to GIVEMESPORT, Chelsea have no plans to allow Estevao to leave on loan for the 2025-26 campaign. The report claims that the Blues view him as a member of the first-team squad and are keen to offer him regular playing time. Estevao's agent, Andre Cury, supposedly sought assurances during his discussions with Chelsea that the attacker would be given the chance to impress in the first team. Cury was wary of Estevao following a similar path to his fellow client Vitor Roque, who struggled to get regular game time for Barcelona following his move to La Liga in January. After being deemed surplus to requirements at Barcelona, Roque was allowed to join Real Betis on a loan deal for the 2024-25 season.",

Tottenham Hotspur manager Ange Postecoglou has confirmed that his side considered a move for Ivan Toney before making Dominic Solanke their club-record signing in a £65m deal. The Lilywhites did not splash the cash on a big-money Harry Kane replacement last summer, but the hierarchy made it a priority to sign a new seasoned number nine for the 2024-25 campaign. A bidding war was expected to materialise for Toney, who was due to see his Brentford contract expire in 2025 and was at one point said to have been valued at £100m by the Bees amid interest from Arsenal and Chelsea. However, Brentford never managed to drum up serious Premier League interest in the England international, despite drastically lowering their asking price, and he eventually joined Al-Ahli in a £40m deal on deadline day.

Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca has moved to remove any doubt as to where he could use each of his attackers this season.

There has been surprise at the amount of players that have been acquired for the final third, particularly when none are recognised central-forwards. Pedro Neto, Jadon Sancho and Joao Felix have all been brought in by the club's recruitment team, Maresca now having eight attackers at his disposal.

Nevertheless, while speaking at a press conference on Friday, the Italian took the opportunity to provide clarity over the pecking order for the four positions. © Imago\n\nWho will play where? Maresca has seemingly decided to have two players for each position, even though some of his comments contradict where they have actually been used during the opening month of the season. In terms of the right flank, Maresca suggested that Noni Madueke and Neto - who has been deployed on the left since his arrival from Wolverhampton Wanderers - are in direction competition. Sancho will seemingly rival Mykhaylo Mudryk for the left-wing spot, that theoretically a hint that Maresca views the former as a regular starter.

Match preview\n\n© Imago\n\nIn what was ultimately his last act as Roma manager, Daniele De Rossi was sent off at the end of his side's 1-1 draw at Genoa last week, when conceding a stoppage-time equaliser left the capital club languishing 16th in the early Serie A standings. Having taken over as head coach in January, replacing Jose Mourinho, De Rossi was handed a three-year contract extension during the summer, but only eight months after returning to his beloved club he was told to leave by the Friedkin family. Wasting no time to name a replacement, ex-Torino coach Ivan Juric was appointed, and he has been tasked with turning things around amid promises of fan protests this weekend. Roma have not only made a winless start to the Serie A campaign - following two goalless draws and a home defeat to Empoli with last week's frustrating result in Genoa - but they have also won just one of their last nine league games stretching back to last season.

Prior to their stalemate in Bergamo, Arsenal emerged triumphant by a goal to nil over North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, where Gabriel Magalhaes nodded in a corner from Bukayo Saka, already the Englishman's fourth assist of the campaign. Here, Sports Mole takes a closer look at Saka's record against Man City ahead of Sunday's tantalising contest. Bukayo Saka record vs. Man City\n\n© Imago\n\nPlayed: 11\n\nWon: 1\n\nDrawn: 1\n\nLost: 9\n\nGoals: 2\n\nAssists: 1\n\nThe numbers unsurprisingly do not make for positive reading for Saka, whose 11 matches against Man City for Arsenal have only brought one victory, in addition to one stalemate and a whopping nine defeats. The 23-year-old has only been responsible for two goals and one assist against the reigning Premier League champions in that time, and the one helper came for Leandro Trossard's equaliser in the 2023 Community Shield.",

While Nico Hulkenberg has already been signed by the Swiss-German team, current Sauber drivers Valtteri Bottas and Guanyu Zhou appear to be feeling uneasy about their spots on next year's grid. \"Not really,\" Bottas said in Singapore when asked if he has any information about when Audi's new F1 chief, Mattia Binotto, will make a decision. \"I can't really share much.\" As for Zhou, the Chinese driver seems to be preparing to take his sponsorship elsewhere next year, almost certainly stepping into a reserve driver role. \"If I have to wait (for a comeback),\" he said, \"it will be a very short, limited time. I don't want to be a third driver in Formula 1 for the rest of my life.\" Audi initially seemed interested in fielding an experienced duo for 2025, but with Colapinto performing so well at Williams and Sauber also showing interest in Gabriel Bortoleto—an F1 driver with links to Fernando Alonso—there might be renewed interest in young rookies. \"Yeah, I'm impressed,\" said three-time world champion Max Verstappen when asked about Colapinto's recent standout performances and the even younger Haas driver for 2025, Oliver Bearman. \"They're doing a good job when they jump in,\" said Verstappen.",

Match preview\n\n© Imago\n\nAfter winning League Two in 2023-24, Stockport County are embarking on a remarkable season in League One, especially considering they were a National League side as recently as 2021-22. Challinor's team are unbeaten in League One so far this term, and have managed three wins and two draws, a record that sees them currently in the promotion playoff spots.

Across the first five games of their league campaign, The Hatters have scored nine goals and conceded just two, meaning that just six teams have netted more often, and no team has a better defensive record than Challinor's side in League One. This defensive resilience was also seen in League Two last season, when Stockport secured the title with the second-best defensive record. © Imago\n\nMeanwhile, visitors Leyton Orient have struggled so far this term, and their record of four losses and one singular victory from their opening five games has positioned them in the relegation zone early in the season.",

A surprising and intense rumour about Red Bull's driver lineups for Formula 1 made waves in the Singapore GP paddock on Thursday. Initially, all the talk centred around Daniel Ricciardo, with strong rumours suggesting that this weekend could mark his 257th and last start in F1. Reports indicate that Red Bull has exercised Liam Lawson's contract option, which was set to expire in just a few days. This decision could see Lawson not only secure a seat in 2025 but potentially replace Australian Ricciardo from the Austin GP onwards this year. At 35, Ricciardo has acknowledged that he expects to be informed of the team's plans for the 2025 season over the weekend. However, he remained adamant about keeping his place on the grid for the remainder of 2024. When questioned about whether Red Bull had the right to remove him from the car for the US GP, he replied, \"I don't think so,\" before adding \"Actually, I would say no. But I'm not a lawyer.\" Ricciardo also recognised the unpredictable nature of the sport, saying \"We know how things work in the sport. You can never be 100 percent sure. So I wouldn't bet my house on it. I've been in the game too long for that.\" German publication Auto Motor und Sport believes Red Bull boss Christian Horner and sponsor Visa are keen for Ricciardo to stay on for 2024, while the influential Red Bull advisor Dr Helmut Marko is reportedly pushing for the younger Lawson, who is 22.",

Nottingham Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo has been dealt a major blow over the fitness of Ibrahim Sangare ahead of Sunday's trip to Brighton & Hove Albion in the Premier League. The Ivorian midfielder missed last week's 1-0 upset of Liverpool, which he was initially labelled a \"doubt\" for, but it has now been reported that he is facing a couple of months on the sidelines with a torn hamstring. Sangare joins fellow midfielder Danilo in the medical bay - the Brazilian will likely be out until 2025 with a fractured ankle - while Willy Boly (calf) is close to returning but will not make the cut either. Regardless, Santo will surely not even consider changing the backline that unexpectedly shut out Liverpool last weekend, as Ola Aina, Alex Moreno, Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic shield Matz Sels. Ryan Yates and James Ward-Prowse are poised to form an unchanged pairing in the Forest engine room, as Morgan Gibbs-White pulls the strings further ahead; the England international has created the most chances from open play of any Premier League player this season (11). Callum Hudson-Odoi and Anthony Elanga were both forced to make do with second-half cameos against Liverpool last weekend, but the former's sublime winner off the bench will surely earn him a recall over Elliot Anderson.
