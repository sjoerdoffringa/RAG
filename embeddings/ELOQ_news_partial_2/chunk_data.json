According to the 2024 North American Airport Satisfaction Survey from JD Power, Orange County’s John Wayne Airport is the best large airport in North America. The “large airport” category includes airports that receive between 10 and 32.9 million passengers per year. Orange County’s lone commercial airport beat out competitors like Tampa International Airport (No. 2), Kansas City International Airport (No. 3), Dallas Love Field (No. 4) and Nashville International Airport (No. 5). Other California airports ranked in that category include Sacramento International Airport (No. 7), San Jose International Airport (No. 10), Oakland International Airport (No. 19) and San Diego International Airport (No. 21). Other California airports earned high placements in other categories. In the “mega airport” category, for airports that receive 33 million or more passengers per year, Los Angeles International Airport ranked No. 13. Topping that category was Minnesota’s Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport. Rounding out the top five included Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (No. 2), Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (No. 3), John F. Kennedy International Airport (No. 4) and Dallas/Forth Worth International Airport (No. 5). For medium airports, which receive between 4.5 to 9.9 million passengers per year, Ontario International Airport ranked No.",

Their parents still fight for answers\n\nPhotos of 43 students who have been missing for 10 years cover the stairs at their former Raúl Isidro Burgos Rural Normal School in Ayotzinapa, Guerrero state, Mexico, Saturday, Aug. 24, 2024. (AP Photo/Felix Marquez)\n\nTIXTLA, México (AP) — Clemente Rodríguez has been documenting the long search for his missing son with tattoos. First, it was an ink drawing of a turtle — a symbol of 19-year-old Christian Rodríguez's school — with a smaller turtle on its shell. Then, an image of Mexico's patron saint, the Virgin of Guadalupe, accompanied by the number 43. Later, a tiger for strength and a dove for hope. “How else is my son going to know that I have been looking for him?” asked Rodríguez. To the heartbroken father, the body art is evidence that he never stopped searching — proof he could perhaps one day show to his boy. On Sept. 26, 2014, Christian Rodríguez, a tall boy who loved to folk dance and had just enrolled in a teachers college in the southern state of Guerrero, disappeared along with 42 classmates. Every year since, on the 26th of each month, Clemente Rodríguez, his wife, Luz María Telumbre, and other families meet at the Rural Normal School at Ayotzinapa and take a long bus ride to the capital, Mexico City, to demand answers. They will do so again next week, on the 10th anniversary of their sons’ disappearance. “It is hard, very hard,” Clemente Rodríguez said.",

Pandas are native to China and an international symbol of the country. Chow Chows were painted to resemble pandas at a Chinese zoo (TikTok)\n\nIn one visitor’s video, one of the “pandas” was visibly panting while resting on a rock in a fence, while another clip had a panda with a long tail strolling about. “It’s a PANdog,” one viewer wrote, while someone else joked: “That’s the Temu version of a panda.”\n\n“They were panting that’s why they are pandas,” a third noted. After visitors publicized the ruse on social media, the organizers admitted they’d painted two Chow Chows — a fluffy dog breed originally from northern China — with black-and-white panda markings. Since then, visitors have demanded their money back for false advertising. This isn’t the first time a Chinese zoo has misled visitors with claims of housing real pandas. In May, NBC Newsreported that Taizhou Zoo in Jiangsu Province had also painted Chow Chows. Zoo representatives initially claimed that the animals were a rare breed of “panda dogs,” before admitting that such animals don’t exist. At the time, zoo officials told Chinese state media they had advertised them as “panda dogs,” and did not intentionally mislead anyone.",

The resignations follow drawn-out negotiations with 23andMe CEO and co-founder Anne Wojcicki, who wants to take the company private. In a Tuesday letter addressed to Wojcicki, the seven directors said they had yet to receive a “a fully financed, fully diligenced, actionable proposal that is in the best interests of the non-affiliated shareholders” from the chief executive after months of efforts. The directors said they would be resigning effective immediately — arguing that, while they still believed in 23andMe's mission, their departures were for the best due to Wojcicki’s concentrated voting power and a “clear” difference of opinion on the company's future. Wojcicki later responded to the resignations in a memo to employees, published in a securities filing, saying she was “surprised and disappointed” by the directors' decision. Still, she maintained that taking 23andMe private and “outside of the short term pressures of the public markets” would be best for the company long term. Wojcicki added that 23andMe would immediately be identifying independent directors to join the board. Wojcicki, who holds 49% of the voting power at 23andMe, was the only remaining board member listed on the company's website as of Thursday. A spokesperson had no further updates to share when reached by The Associated Press. 23andMe, which went public in 2021, has struggled to find a profitable business model since. The company reported a net loss of $667 million for its last fiscal year, more than double the loss of $312 million for the year prior.",

What they found spells potential disaster for the planet\n\nScientists using ice-breaking ships and underwater robots have found the Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica is melting at an accelerating rate and could be on an irreversible path to collapse, spelling catastrophe for global sea level rise. Since 2018, a team of scientists forming the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, has been studying Thwaites — often dubbed the “Doomsday Glacier” — up close to better understand how and when it might collapse. Their findings, set out across a collection of studies, provide the clearest picture yet of this complex, ever-changing glacier. The outlook is “grim,” the scientists said in a report published Thursday, revealing the key conclusions of their six years of research. They found rapid ice loss is set to speed up this century. Thwaites’ retreat has accelerated considerably over the past 30 years, said Rob Larter, a marine geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey and part of the ITGC team. “Our findings indicate it is set to retreat further and faster,” he said. The scientists project Thwaites and the Antarctic Ice Sheet could collapse within 200 years, which would have devastating consequences. Thwaites holds enough water to increase sea levels by more than 2 feet. But because it also acts like a cork, holding back the vast Antarctic ice sheet, its collapse could ultimately lead to around 10 feet of sea level rise, devastating coastal communities from Miami and London to Bangladesh and the Pacific Islands.

(Anders Wiklund/TT News Agency via AP)\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Swedish authorities on Thursday charged a 52-year-old woman associated with the Islamic State group with genocide, crimes against humanity and serious war crimes against Yazidi women and children in Syria — the first such case on trial in the Scandinavian country. Lina Laina Ishaq, who's a Swedish citizen, allegedly committed the crimes from August 2014 to December 2016, in the city of Raqqa, the former de facto capital of the militant group's self-proclaimed caliphate and home to about 300,000 people. The crimes “took place under IS rule in Raqqa, and this is the first time that IS attacks against the Yazidi minority have been tried in Sweden,” senior prosecutor Reena Devgun said in a statement. The Yazidis are one of Iraq’s oldest religious minorities. “Women, children and men were regarded as property and subjected to being traded as slaves, sexual slavery, forced labor, deprivation of liberty and extrajudicial executions,” Devgun said. “IS tried to annihilate the Yazidi ethnic group on an industrial scale.\" In announcing the charges, Devgun told a news conference that the prosecutors were able to identify Ishaq through information from the U.N. team investigating atrocities in Iraq, known as UNITAD. In a separate statement, the Stockholm District Court said the prosecution claims she detained a number of women and children of the Yazidi ethnic group in her residence in Raqqa, and “allegedly exposed them to, among other things, severe suffering, torture or other inhumane treatment\" and also deprived \"them of fundamental rights for cultural, religious and gender reasons contrary to general international law.”\n\nAccording to the charge sheet, obtained by The Associated Press, Ishaq is suspected of holding nine people, including children, in her Raqqa home for up to seven months and treating them as slaves.",

Credit: Getty Images\n\nResearchers have finally identified the source of mysterious noises coming from the deepest ocean trench. The odd sounds, described as \"biotwang\" noises, sound a bit like sci-fi starships, and are actually whale calls from Bryde's whales (Balaenoptera edeni). The whales may use the calls to locate one another like a giant game of Marco Polo, researchers say. Scientists first detected the unusual noises in 2014 while using underwater gliders to carry out an acoustic survey of the Mariana Trench — the world's deepest ocean trench, which spans more than 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers) south of Japan and has a maximum depth of 35,876 feet (10,935 meters) . The biotwang sound can be broken down into two distinct parts: first, a low, grumbly sound that reverberates through the deep; and second, a high-pitched, metallic ringing that researchers have likened to the sounds made by spaceships in Star Trek and Star Wars. The sounds initially stumped scientists. But in 2016, researchers revealed that biotwang was most likely a call from large baleen whales , such as blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) or humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). However, the sounds did not match any known whale calls. In the new study, published Wednesday (Sept. 18) in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science , researchers were finally able to prove that Bryde's whales were making the noises, thanks in part to new artificial intelligence (AI) tools that sifted through over 200,000 hours of audio recordings containing various ocean sounds.",

        "text": "Chefs often consider tenderloin or filet mignon to be overrated cuts of steak, but Gordon Ramsay disagrees. The filet, or filet mignon, is one of his \"favorite cuts of all time\" because it is \"packed with flavor\" (per YouTube). Due to its leanness, it's a cut that can easily overcook and become dry, which is why it's one of the worst cuts of steak to grill. But Ramsay uses an unexpected ingredient to keep it juicy: chicken stock. First, the chef sears both sides of his meat in a skillet — laying the meat away from you rather than towards you is Ramsay's tip for not burning yourself when making steak. Then he adds garlic, rosemary, thyme, and a bay leaf before pouring in the stock. Adding the extra liquid means more moist meat since some of it is absorbed by the steak as it cooks and rests. As the stock cooks down and absorbs the flavors from the aromatics, it also becomes an easy pan sauce to accompany the filet. Chicken stock works well because it has a delicate taste that won't overpower a less robustly flavored cut such as filet mignon. Ramsay likes to make his own stock, which he describes as \"the vital ingredient to good cooking\" (via Facebook). But you could use store-bought if it's easier, or try different flavors for other cuts. A richer beef stock might suit an intensely savory sirloin, for example.

Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters that Moscow was concerned by what she called increasingly \"provocative\" activity on the border with Belarus, saying she did not rule out that there could be attempts to escalate in the region. Days after Ukraine's surprise Aug. 6 incursion into Russia's Kursk region, Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko - a loyal ally of President Vladimir Putin - suggested, without providing evidence, that Kyiv may have ideas about attacking Belarus. Minsk, which has accused Ukrainian drones of violating its airspace, later announced it was sending extra troops to its border with Ukraine, though Kyiv said it had seen no major changes in the border area. \"We take due note of the information received about the intensification of the activities of Ukrainian forces in the border zone,\" said Zakharova. \"We see these facts ourselves and are aware of constant attempts from the Ukrainian side to use drones and to send terrorists into the republic,\" she added. Ukraine's foreign ministry said last month that the country \"has never taken and is not going to take any unfriendly actions against the Belarusian people\". In a clear reference to Ukraine's Kursk incursion, Zakharova said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had shown he was capable of what she called \"reckless steps\", accusing him of coordinating his action with Washington ahead of a November U.S. presidential election.",

Two weeks earlier she had taken part in the murder of Bian Zhongyun, deputy principal of the Beijing high school she attended, one of the first – and one of the most notorious – of the murders that inaugurated a decade of slaughter in which between one and two million people were killed. In 2014, however, Song’s public apology for her involvement in the murder – one of the most high-profile expressions of contrition by a former Red Guard – provoked a mixture of scorn and calls for a national reckoning for the suffering and carnage of 1966-76. In 2013 China’s leader President Xi Jinping had issued a directive banning discussions of “the party’s past mistakes”, and after news of Song Binbin’s apology spread on the internet, the Chinese State Internet Information Office issued a further directive. “Due to the complicated public opinion situation on the Internet,” it read, “all websites are to cool down on their reporting of Song Binbin’s apology.

Instead of settling for high down payments and rising mortgage rates stateside, Russell made an unexpected choice: he bought a 2.5-acre off-grid island in Finland for just $31,000. But, given that Russell is half-Finnish and he spent his childhood summers there, Russell’s choice wasn’t completely unorthodox.

(Kaitlin Newman/The Baltimore Banner via AP, File)\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) — It was just another overnight shift for Damon Davis, a road construction inspector who was supervising repairs on Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge — until the deck beneath his feet started crumbling. He ran for his life and, miraculously, made it to safety moments before the bridge collapsed into the water below. “You can visualize, as he is coming forward, the bridge is collapsing behind him,” said Baltimore attorney Billy Murphy, whose firm is representing Davis in a liability case against the owner and manager of the Dali, the massive container ship that veered off course and crashed into one of the bridge’s supporting columns in March. The attorneys held a news conference Thursday to announce their upcoming claim. Six members of the road crew whose work Davis was inspecting that night died in the collapse and another narrowly survived falling from the bridge. Their job that night was filling potholes on the bridge deck. A last-minute mayday call from the ship’s pilot allowed police officers to stop traffic to the bridge, but they didn’t have time to alert the road crew. The workers were on break when disaster struck. Most were sitting in their construction vehicles and had no warning about the impending collapse. The man who survived the fall, Julio Cervantes Suarez, was able to manually roll down the window of his rapidly sinking truck and climb out into the frigid water of the Patapsco River, where he clung to a piece of floating debris until he was rescued by first responders.",

The case stemmed from Ronald Akins, a former long-time girls basketball coach who was arrested years ago for grooming and sexual assault.

On Wednesday Kingfisher taxpayers and leaders met at a Kingfisher County Excise Board meeting where frustrations were given regarding a new property owner tax. The outcry comes over a $5 million settlement of a football hazing lawsuit where property owners in Kingfisher school district are mad that they’re being told their taxes will go up for three years to pay $3.75 million of the settlement. Estimates came in that the increase could be as much as 12%. Kingfisher wasn’t insured, so much of the cost ended up being pushed towards taxpayers. “Knowing what happened in Kingfisher and now hearing the settlement last night here, I know that we’re not flush with millions of dollars of cash,” said Robert Helms, who moved to Ninnekah four years ago.",

His message was entitled \"For those who didn't get it the first time\" - an apparent reference to a warning by Putin last week that the West would be directly fighting Russia if it let Ukraine fire the long-range missiles onto Russian territory. The Ukraine war has triggered the biggest confrontation between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, which is considered to be the time when the two Cold War superpowers came closest to intentional nuclear war. The outgoing head of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, told The Times this week that the Kremlin leader had declared \"many red lines\" before but not escalated conflict with the West when they were crossed. Putin's spokesman said his comment was dangerous and provocative. In a non-binding resolution adopted on Thursday, the European Parliament asked EU countries to \"immediately lift restrictions on the use of Western weapons systems delivered to Ukraine against legitimate military targets on Russian territory.\" Volodin wrote: \"If something like this happens, Russia will give a tough response using more powerful weapons. No one should have any illusions about this.\"",

I can see it coming,” said Robert Baer, a former CIA case officer. He said the recent explosions of pagers and VHF radios being used by Hezbollah operatives in Lebanon is a logical prelude to an invasion.\n\n“Netanyahu has promised that he’s going to go in, and I think it’s going to be a ground invasion. And it’s going to be very destructive, just as destructive as it was in Gaza,” Baer told NewsNation’s “CUOMO” on Wednesday.\n\nRegarding the collateral damage from the booby-trapped pagers and radios that exploded this week, Baer said the alternative would have been trying to destroy Hezbollah communications with bombs, which would have produced far more civilian casualties.\n\nBlinken says US did not know about exploding pagers in Lebanon, calls for restraint\n\nBut when it comes to worrying about collateral damage, “after 7 October, all rules are gone,” Baer said. “It was such a shock to Israel. The gloves are off.”\n\nAnswering Chris Cuomo’s question of whether it is wrong for Israel to set off explosives that were carried by people in public places including markets and buses, Baer was blunt.\n\n“Everything that goes on in the Middle East is wrong. International law is gone.”\n\nBaer also fears that a greater conflict will “cascade” and could spread violence to Iran, the Persian Gulf, “and who knows where it goes from there.”\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

(Amy Beth Bennett/South Florida Sun-Sentinel via AP)\n\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Jennifer Heath Box had few worries as she exited her cruise ship at Fort Lauderdale’s port on Christmas Eve 2022. The Texan and her husband had spent six days at sea celebrating with her brother, a Georgia police officer who had just completed cancer treatment. In two hours the couple had a flight home to Houston, where they would spend Christmas with their Marine son, who was leaving for a three-year deployment in Japan, and two other adult children. But according to a federal civil rights lawsuit filed Thursday by Box against the Broward County Sheriff's Office, its deputies wrongly arrested her as she disembarked and then jailed her for three days, subjecting her to a body cavity search and blasting her cell with death metal music and freezing air. Deputies accused the 50-year-old financial systems administrator of being a much younger woman with a similar name who was wanted in Harris County, Texas, for felony child endangerment. Harris County had mistakenly put Box's photo on its warrant, but none of the other information matched. “I’ve never done anything to where I would find myself on the other side of bars,\" Box said at a Thursday press conference near Port Everglades, Florida. \"It was really difficult for me because I had to call my kids and tell them that I wasn’t going to be there” for Christmas.",

Running an electric vehicle (EV) can cost more than 24p per mile, while a diesel vehicle is 12.5p. It costs as much as 80p per kilowatt hour to charge an EV using a rapid or ultra-rapid device on the roadside, according to data from the app ZapMap. A typical electric car will travel 3.3 miles for every kWh of electricity used, meaning rapid and ultra-rapid chargers currently cost the equivalent of 24.1p per mile, calculations by The Times suggest. Slower chargers cost 16.4p per mile. This is about double the average diesel car, which will do 43 miles per gallon, resulting in a cost of 12.5p per mile at current prices. A typical petrol car costs 14.5p per mile, according to the analysis. A return journey from London to Penzance would cost £148 in an electric car using rapid chargers, The Times said, compared with £77 in a diesel car and £89 using petrol. It added that at-home charging is much cheaper, at less than a third of the price of the average rapid charger. ZapMap found that prices at rapid chargers have increased by 5 per cent over the past year, despite a 30 per cent decrease in the wholesale cost of electricity. This has coincided with a fall in the price of oil. Even drivers who choose slower public chargers – the threshold is 50 Wh of power, allowing a full recharge in around 30 minutes – are paying more per mile than petrol and diesel drivers.",

A Sandy mother told ABC4 that her daughter “ran into the house screaming and terrified” because of the loud booms, but she did not have any answers to give her. “Nobody knew what was happening,” Lola Amacher said. “I could hear the elementary school kids outside playing at recess … and you can hear all the kids screaming.”\n\nAccording to the Salt Lake Valley Emergency Communications Center, Amacher was not the only resident seeking answers on whether or not to take her family to safety. Executive Director Ivan Whitaker said dispatch received more than 1,300 calls from noon to 1 p.m., 431 of which came through the 911 emergency line. PREVIOUS STORY: Large booms felt and heard throughout Salt Lake Valley\n\nThis is a massive spike when compared to normal day activity, where the emergency center receives an average of 150 to 200 calls during that same time frame. Whitaker said it was an “all hands on deck” situation, with supervisors and managers jumping in to help field the large increase in calls. Even with additional staff answering phones, he said several callers were placed on hold. The booms were later confirmed to be Tooele Army Depot detonations. Wade Williams, Tooele Army Depot public affairs officer, said this was the ninth time they detonated old, obsolete, and unsafe munition this year.",

And a huge strike on southern Beirut on Friday.\n\nIsraeli attacks on Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia, this week constitute a significant escalation in the 11-month war between the two sides. For nearly a year, Israel and Hezbollah have fought a low-level conflict, mostly along the Israeli-Lebanese border, that has gradually gathered force without ever exploding into an all-out war.\n\nNow, Israel is attempting a riskier playbook. It has markedly increased the intensity of its attacks in an attempt to force Hezbollah to back down, while raising the chances of the opposite outcome: a more aggressive response from Hezbollah that devolves into an unbridled land war.\n\nIsrael has sabotaged Hezbollah’s communications devices, blowing up hundreds, if not thousands, of them in a widespread cyberattack. Its fighter jets have pounded southern Lebanon with rare intensity. And on Friday afternoon, they struck Beirut, the Lebanese capital, for the first time since July — killing a senior Hezbollah military commander, according to Israeli officials, and collapsing two buildings, according to Lebanese officials.\n\nYet, despite the escalation, the fundamental balance between the two sides appeared to remain unchanged on Friday afternoon, at least for the time being.\n\nIsrael’s moves fell short of a decisive blow, humiliating Hezbollah and spreading horror through Lebanese society, but so far failing to coerce the militia into changing course.",

Natacha, who began working for the former Harrods owner when she was 19, described the escalating abuse she experienced from her then boss at a news conference on Friday. Survivors \"didn't really realise\" what was going on at the time, feeling that the assaults were part of the job, Natacha said. \"I have daughters and nieces and the thought of that happening to them at [a] tender age is just awful,\" she said. Warning: this story contains details some may find distressing. \"It feels odd after all these years to be able to speak about it,\" Natacha told the BBC's Helena Wilkinson at the press conference, organised by a legal team representing survivors. The case against Harrods' current owners, who the lawyers argue are liable for damages, was outlined at the conference. The current owners of the department store, who did not own it at the time of the allegations, said they were appalled by the accusations. \"The Harrods of today is a very different organisation,\" the company said in a statement. The department store has a compensation scheme for ex-employees who say they were attacked by Fayed. The company has already reached financial settlements with the majority of people who have approached them since 2023. More have contacted Harrods since a BBC investigation heard testimony from more than 20 women who said they were sexually assaulted by the billionaire.",

Giving harrowing details of what is alleged to have taken place, the legal team and one of Fayed's many alleged victims recounted how the former owner of Harrods used his power to force himself on women, had them followed and made them have sexual health checks. The legal team representing 37 women who say they were sexually assaulted or raped by the late billionaire spoke publicly to outline how the former Harrods boss used \"his wealth and power to manipulate and control victims\". Here are five things we learned. Warning: this story contains details some may find distressing. 'Serial sexual abuser'\n\nFayed was a \"serial sexual abuser\" whose abuse was \"constant and repetitive\" over 25 years, barrister Dean Armstrong KC said. \"I have many years of practice... I have never seen a case as horrific as this,\" he told the news conference. \"This case combines some of the most horrific elements of the cases involving Jimmy Savile, Jeffrey Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. \"Savile because in this case, as in that, the institution, we say, knew about the behaviour\", Mr Armstrong continued. \"Epstein because in that case, as in this, there was a procurement system in place to source the women and girls. As you know, there are some very young victims. \"And Weinstein, because it was a person at the very top of the organisation who was abusing his power.",

And for the first time, volunteers - civilians who joined the armed forces after the start of the war - now make up the highest number of people killed on the battlefield since Russia’s full-scale invasion began in 2022. Every day, the names of those killed in Ukraine, their obituaries and photographs from their funerals are published across Russia in the media and on social networks. BBC Russian and the independent website Mediazona have collated these names, along with names from other open sources, including official reports. We checked that the information had been shared by authorities or relatives of the deceased - and that they had been identified as dying in the war. New graves in cemeteries have also helped provide the names of soldiers killed in Ukraine - these are usually marked by flags and wreaths sent by the defence ministry. We have identified the names of 70,112 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine, but the actual number is believed to be considerably higher. Some families do not share details of their relatives’ deaths publicly - and our analysis does not include names we were unable to check, or the deaths of militia in Russian-occupied Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine. Among them, 13,781 were volunteers - about 20% - and fatalities among volunteers now exceed other categories. Former prisoners, who joined up in return for pardons for their crimes, were previously the highest but they now account for 19% of all confirmed deaths.",

An old tourist sign boasts of a border with Myanmar made of just “bamboo fences, ditches and earth ridges” - a sign of the easy economic relationship Beijing had sought to build with its neighbour. Now the border the BBC visited is marked by a high, metal fence running through the county of Ruili in Yunnan province. Topped by barbed wire and surveillance cameras in some places, it cuts through rice fields and carves up once-adjoined streets. China’s tough pandemic lockdowns forced the separation initially. But it has since been cemented by the intractable civil war in Myanmar, triggered by a bloody coup in 2021. The military regime is now fighting for control in large swathes of the country, including Shan State along China’s border, where it has suffered some of its biggest losses. The crisis at its doorstep - a nearly 2,000km (1,240-mile) border - is becoming costly for China, which has invested millions of dollars in Myanmar for a critical trade corridor. The ambitious plan aims to connect China’s landlocked south-west to the Indian Ocean via Myanmar. But the corridor has become a battleground between Myanmar rebels and the country's army. Beijing has sway over both sides but the ceasefire it brokered in January fell apart. It has now turned to military exercises along the border and stern words. Foreign Minister Wang Yi was the latest diplomat to visit Myanmar’s capital Nay Pyi Taw and is thought to have delivered a warning to the country's ruler Min Aung Hlaing.",

Mustard ingredients - including mustard powder or flour - can be found in dips, sauces, salads and pre-packed sandwiches, the FSA said. It is trying to identify how many products may be affected - around 50 have already been recalled. Parents of children with a peanut allergy should check the labels of food they are buying and ask restaurants and take-away outlets about foods that might contain mustard, the agency says. Some of the products being recalled, or removed from sale, because they may contain peanuts include Dominos dips, SPAR sandwich fillers and salads, and Harvester BBQ sauce. The Food Standards Agency has traced the contaminated mustard ingredients to a producer in India called GT Agro Industries. One company, called FGS Ingredients, has been identified as supplying their mustard ingredients for use in UK food. Because of how serious allergic reactions to peanuts can be, the FSA says it is taking a precautionary approach, so that people with allergies can keep themselves safe. Rebecca Sudworth, director of food policy at the FSA, said: “Those with a peanut allergy should avoid consuming products containing mustard as an ingredient until we identify the individual products affected. \"As soon as we have more information, we will update consumers,\" she added. According to the agency, if mustard is present in a food, it should be labelled in bold on the packet because it is an allergen itself.",

The bronze blade, thought to be around 3,000 years old, has the markings of Ramesses II, hailed as the most powerful king of ancient Egypt. Many scholars, as well as Hollywood movies, have suggested that Ramesses was the pharaoh who enslaved the Israelites in the Book of Exodus\n\nAs the story goes, Moses freed the group from the pharaoh's control, then famously parted the Red Sea and delivered the Israelites to the Promise Land. The sword was uncovered among the ruins of an ancient military fort in Housh Eissa, a city just south of Alexandria, which featured barracks for soldiers and storage rooms for food, weapons and other goods. The shimmering sword found in Egypt likely belonged to a high-ranking military official under the reign of Ramesses II who some scholars claimed is the pharaoh mentioned in the Bible\n\nRamesses, who ruled from 1279 to 1213BC, was known for his military power and strategic genius, leading an army of around 100,000 men strong. The ancient sword likely did not belong to the famous king, but likely to one of his soldiers stationed at the fort, experts said. Elizabeth Frood, an Oxford University Egyptologist who was not involved in the dig, told The Washington Post: 'An object to bear the cartouches of Rameses II would suggest to me that it belonged to someone of relatively high rank. 'To be able to display such an object, even though it would have been presumably in a scabbard, was a marker of status and prestige.' The sword was uncovered at a site called Tell Al-Abqain, which experts said was 'a crucial military outpost.'",

Good old Bridget, I said to myself, as I was folded in the arms of Morpheus. Still at it, eh? I mused. It appears that our heroine will, after 30 years, still be gamely in search of a boyfriend in Mad About The Boy. My eyelids were drooping, but I formed the distinct impression that this time she was actually going to succeed. Incredible, I thought drowsily, when you think of her age (surely 55 plus? ), and when you consider how much more difficult it has all become. When Bridget Jones first started to record her romantic struggles, back in 1995, she struck a chord with millions of people – especially women – who couldn’t find the right partner. They wanted love; they wanted ­happiness, and all other things being equal they probably wanted to get hitched and even to have children. It was the tragicomic predicament of Bridget Jones that she was clever, funny, attractive – and yet couldn’t find the right man. ‘Tick-tock, tick-tock’, her friends would say to her at dinner parties, in a bullying way, to remind her that she might have only a few child-bearing years to go. Since then the obstacles have, if anything, got even bigger. If you are a professional woman like Bridget – who, in the stories, is a TV news producer – you have to think about the exorbitant costs of childcare, which have been steadily increasing, as a proportion of income.",

South Wales Police arrested the people, who are all staff at HMP Parc in Bridgend, on Friday, following a series of incidents at the prison. The police have not said what the incidents relate to, but 13 inmates are known to have died at HMP Parc this year. Detective Chief Inspector Dean Taylor said: 'We received concerns about the conduct of staff at HMP Parc on Wednesday September 18. South Wales Police arrested the people, who are all staff at HMP Parc in Bridgend, on Friday, following a series of incidents at the prison\n\nThe four arrested are a 23-year-old woman from Bridgend; a 45-year-old man from Pontycymer; a 25-year-old man from Merthyr and a 35-year-old man from Llanelli\n\n'Officers are at the early stages of the investigation and are working closely with G4S while inquiries are ongoing.'

G4S has managed the establishment since it opened in 1997 and it received a 10-year contract to continue operating it in 2022.

The slightest smell of chemicals or glint of a kitchen knife could take her back to the apartment where she was ravaged and trigger a crippling panic attack. Now ‘Marion’, as she wishes to be called, had been brought face to face with the monster. The man who held a box-cutter to her throat, sedated her with an ether-soaked gag and tore off her clothes. Yet, there were no tears when she saw Dominique Pelicot again after almost a quarter of a century. She was in such a heightened state of tension that she couldn’t even weep. ‘It was as if she had been electrocuted,’ says Marion’s lawyer, Florence Rault. ‘She seemed to be paralysed by the shock of being in the same room as him again. Every muscle in her body had tensed up.’\n\nDominique Pelicot has been dubbed 'the Monster of Avignon' after he admitted drugging his wife and allowing strangers to rape her in their martial bed\n\nThe moment Mme Rault was describing to me is known in French law as ‘the confrontation’ – a term that captures the melodrama and highly charged emotion of the occasion. In a British criminal investigation, there is nothing remotely like it. It comes towards the end of the probe, when the suspect and victim are brought together so the examining magistrate can question them and compare their stories. In October 2022, when Marion was obliged to confront Pelicot, who had admitted to attacking her, he was just another unknown sex offender.",

Professor Michael Biggs, trustee of the charity Sex Matters, launched a campaign for the latest census data to be looked at again after the ONS suggested there are 262,000 transgender people in the UK. He finally saw some vindication last week after the Office for Statistics Regulations (OSR), the industry watchdog, said in a damning report that the figures were unreliable and must be discarded as an 'accredited official statistic'. It was the first time in more than 220 years of the census that data had been downgraded. The furore began when the 2021 Office for National Statistics (ONS) census – the first to count transgender people – had asked the question: 'Is the gender you identify with the same as your sex registered at birth?' Oxford University professor Professor Michael Biggs says he was shunned and branded a 'transphobe' during a two-year battle to convince the Office for National Statistics it had massively overstated the number of transgender people in Britain\n\nBut the sociology professor instinctively felt there was something not quite right with the figures, when it identified Brent, in northwest London - his home borough - as second to Newham, in east London, with the highest numbers of transgender people. According to the numbers, Newham - at 1.5 per cent - and Brent - at 1.3 per cent - had the highest proportion of transgender people in the UK. If true, these boroughs had trans communities around a third higher in population than Brighton & Hove, where LGBT communities are well-established.",

Katie is capable and controlling, Rachel terminally laidback and Christina warmly emotional, and the tense and sometimes subtly humorous conversations between them, as they try to find their way through the situation, unfold in the manner of a play. If you watch closely you'll see a lot of fine details in the acting, especially in the way the sisters react to each other - watch the difference between what's on their faces and what they actually say. A fair amount of tension builds up from all this, and that makes the turn the story takes in the last third all the more powerful. It's a rewarding film as a result, essentially a celebration of family - and also an uncommonly open and deftly humorous portrait of a time of life that often gets glossed over.",

The proposal to demolish Ashe Park, a Hampshire residence where the celebrated author loved to spend her time, has been submitted by the new homeowners, believed to be from Hong Kong or China. The 232-acre estate near Basingstoke has been described as a 'perfect elegant country home' sitting amongst rolling parkland and space for shooting and fishing in the grounds. The house itself has seven bedrooms including a 'palatial' master chamber, five reception rooms and an 'ornate' library. There are also several outbuildings including a 'party barn' with a cinema, a polo ground, and an 'exceptional' garden with fruit trees and wildflowers. There are plans to demolish Ashe Park in Hampshire near Basingstoke\n\nThe 'perfect' country estate has also been described as 'idyllic'. But the owners find it 'tired' and 'unmanaged'\n\nBut its new owners feel it is 'tired and unmanaged', 'lacks architectural merit' and want to replace it with an entirely new house. Property records show Ashe Park was bought in October 2022 for an eye-watering £17million by Shuk Ting Sharon Leung and Gillian Sin Hang Ho. The oldest parts of the property date back to the 1600s and historic literary figure Austen wrote in her letters about attending balls there in the 1790s. Austen was born in Steventon Rectory, just a mile from the house, and next year is the 250th anniversary of the Pride and Prejudice author's birth. Planning documents show that the new owners claim the current property is 'tired and unmanaged'.",

Their young daughter's name was revealed in a photo showing a Descendants-themed scroll that read: 'Khai Malik,' with an invite from King Ben and his 'councilors' for her to attend Auradon Prep, the school featured in the Disney TV films.

'THE 11TH PIC WHEN IT’S WRITTEN KHAI MALIK,' one fan exclaimed. Gigi Hadid, 29, and ex Zayn Malik, 31, both shared touching tributes to their daughter, Khai, for her fourth birthday on Thursday\n\n'KHAI MALIK\" STOP IM SOBBING,' another wrote.

Of course this chatter related to some of the movie's unsavoury practices - which include 61-year-old Moore's character Elisabeth Sparkle going as far as injecting herself in the spine - all in a bid to stave off the physical effects of ageing by using a protocol described as 'the substance' - but this leads to some unexpected outcomes, including a scene described by some as 'boob vomiting'. In the picture, Moore character is an ageing TV fitness instructor who who once had a prolific career, but now is in her 50s and has been fired from her TV show because of its falling ratings. Demi Moore plays the protagonist Elisabeth Sparkle in new movie The Substance, which has been described as one of the 'most disgusting' films ever (pictured)\n\nThe gruesome movie features a lot of gore, which left some viewers feeling physically sick, according to reports\n\n'A fading celebrity decides to use a black market drug, a cell-replicating substance that temporarily creates a younger, better version of herself,' the IMDb synopsis reads.

In the 10-year run-up to retirement age, people with invested pension funds typically see them shifted out of stock markets and all or part way into bonds, historically regarded as a 'safer' option, and cash. Some 64 per cent are unaware that this de-risking process, known as lifestyling but also sometimes called target-dating, usually happens to pension funds during the period before retirement unless you take active steps to avoid it. Pension lifestyling: In the 10-year run-up to retirement age, people with invested pots typically see them shifted out of stock markets and all or part way into bonds and cash\n\nMeanwhile, just 40 per cent know where their pension is currently invested, according to the survey by RBC Brewin Dolphin. This means millions of people's plans for retirement hinge on ‘lifestyle’ pensions that may not be suitable for them, says the firm. The lifestyling strategy was originally created to position people to buy an annuity, but most people now stay invested in drawdown schemes to fund retirement. Anyone who wants to keep their pension fund invested, perhaps for decades to come in retirement, might want to consider whether it is better to opt out of 'lifestyling' altogether and stick with stocks, which are riskier but have more potential for long-term growth. A bond market crash last autumn meant some older workers who had been defaulted into lifetyled funds discovered to their horror they were sitting on huge losses right on the brink of retirement, which some were forced to delay as a result.",

Adults in the UK sink 39 bottles Sauvignon blanc and Merlot on average each year, data shows. Consumption has soared 12-fold since the 1960s, partly fuelled by higher boozing rates among women. Beer intake, meanwhile, has more than halved since its heyday five decades ago – from the equivalent of 276 pints a year to 110. Industry experts today claimed wine's overthrowing of beer as Britain's best-loved drink was 'a long time coming'. Others guessed the booming popularity of spirits might also see beer overtaken again in the near future. Your browser does not support iframes. Your browser does not support iframes. Figures compiled by the World Health Organization (WHO) show how much alcohol is consumed via different drinks. The typical Briton aged 15 or over consumes 9.75l of pure alcohol each year. How to work out how much pure alcohol is in your drink\n\nMultiply the total number of millilitres by the amount of pure alcohol (ABV). For instance, consider a 750ml bottle of Sauvignon blanc at 14%. To calculate how much pure alcohol this contain, you would multiply 750 by 0.14. This would give you 105ml.

As of 2020, the most recent year there are figures for, we consume 3.12l of alcohol from beer. Wine's surging popularity is thought, in part, to be due to it becoming much more common for women to drink.",

In a new video, Professor Tim Spector, founder of the ZOE diet app, showed how additives called emulsifiers form a gel-like clump in our guts. The clip shows the nutrition expert demonstrating what happens to emulsifiers — used to add bulk to food — in our bowel, by mixing the powder in a bowl with liquid. The clump it forms, he says, plays havoc with the millions of healthy bacteria that live there and are vital for protecting us from diseases like cancer and heart disease. Emulsifiers are used in thousands of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) to help bind ingredients that don't usually mix, like oil and water. Professor Tim Spector has demonstrated the stomach-churning effect of emulsifiers in the gut\n\nThey are found in a range of popular products, including bread, cakes, breakfast cereals and childrens yoghurts. Some experts have linked increasing consumption of additives like emulsifiers with the rise in early onset bowel cancer. Nutrition Lead at Imperial College London Dr Federica Amati explained last month the damage that emulsifiers 'messes up' the separation between the fatty layer and water layer in the gut. This, it has been theorised, breaks down the gut lining, leading to bacterial infections. Last month, microbiome expert Dr Alasdair Scott told The Mail on Sunday: 'We think that this process could be linked to bowel cancer. 'Studies done on animals that confirm this, but not yet on people — in humans it can be much more difficult to prove why exactly a tumour has formed.'",

My 25-year career as an academic neuroscientist, studying the workings of the brain, led me to the conclusion that life after death was a brain-based illusion — until I experienced a journey into the hereafter during a coma after developing meningitis. Now I hold a very different view: the afterlife is real. If science doesn’t recognise this fact, then it is doing two things wrong. In his vision of the afterlife, Dr Eben Alexander was a speck perched on the wing of a butterfly\n\nFirst, science often uses the wrong tools to make measurements. And second, even the most open-minded scientists are a long way from understanding what the right tools will be. We simply haven’t discovered the scientific answers to spiritual questions yet. As a simple example, imagine a young couple at their wedding. As the ceremony ends, they look deep into each other’s eyes — the windows of the soul, as Shakespeare called them.",

Last August, a group of perturbed residents from the town in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland began complaining about a persistent humming noise. Fermanagh and Omagh District Council said it's environmental health service went on to receive a further 10 complaints up to April of this year. Conspiracy theories about what was causing the noise - that one resident says 'went on for hours and hours' - began to spread far and wide. The council eventually commissioned a noise consultant to find the cause, with the council admitting in June the search had been 'complex', but the specialists had been able to 'hone in on a specific spot'. Things that go hum in the night: Noise experts have finally identified the source of a low-level hum disturbing the residents of Omagh - but the culprit can't be named for legal reasons\n\nIt is believed they have a good idea of where the noise was coming from, but council chiefs say they will remain tight-lipped about the source. John Boyle, the council's director of community and wellbeing at the council, told his colleagues that 'unless there are formal, public legal proceedings, we would not be naming the source of that noise', The Times reports. Boyle reported the findings to the regeneration and community committee, in which he revealed how the experts went about trying to trace the source. He wrote: 'A calibrated recording of the hum' was made using a sound level meter within a complainant's home and shared with the noise consultant who identified 'a significant dominant acoustic tone considered to be an indicative component of the hum … This distinct tone was likely to be associated with the operation of a fan or ventilation-type equipment.'",

While they're not particularly new, our love for them is showcased courtesy of social media, where you'll find literally hundreds of thousands of posts dedicated to these simple-but-perfect creations. Burgers are everywhere, with big hitters not just in the capital but across the country, attracting regular queues of aficionados at restaurants and shops as well as street food vendors. There's something about the crispy crust, thin patties and general oozy goodness that is unrivalled. Ellen Manning made smash burgers at home - starting with beef mince\n\nShe then 'smashed it down'. It creates a crunchy thinner patty - using the 'maillard' effect\n\nThe key is in the Maillard reaction - named after French chemist Louis Camille Maillard, who discovered that when amino acids and reducing sugars react, they create a distinctive flavour in the browned result that gets our taste buds tingling in a way that's strangely addictive. Achieving this reaction in a burger takes plenty of heat, good meat, and the trademark 'smashing' technique that sees balls of minced beef squished and squashed until the patty itself is thin as thin can be, with the crust we have all come to love. We might not have big rigs in our own homes, designed to smash hundreds of patties on a production line to feed hungry burger-lovers. But we can recreate a few of our own with the right tactics.The starting point is the meat itself.",

New York City-based banker Renata Rojas delivered harrowing testimony about the doomed mission on the fourth day of a public hearing into tragedy, which is being held by the US Coast Guard Marine Board of Investigation in South Carolina. She described her role in helping the launch last June and said that all on board understood the risks involved in their dive deep beneath the Atlantic Ocean to see the wreck of the Titanic. 'This was never sold as a Disney ride,' she said. 'It was an expedition that … things happen and you have to adapt to change.' The inquiry, which will last two weeks, has seen new evidence come to light as investigators probe exactly what happened in the hours between the vessel losing contact with its support vessel and its implosion 3,700 metres below the surface. A chilling 3D reconstruction of the Titan's final journey was released by the US Coast Guard, depicting its final movements, after new footage of the wreckage on the seabed was also revealed, taken days after tragedy unfolded. Ms Rojas testified that she had herself taken part in test dives before the disaster on June 18, adding: 'I knew what I was doing was very risky,' she said. 'I never at any point felt unsafe by the operation.' She is one of several people to have appeared before the ongoing hearing, but her testimony was different from others who have largely described a dysfunctional operation destined for failure. Another witness - OceanGate's scientific director - said that the submersible had malfunctioned just three days before the tragedy, noting that he did not know whether it had been checked over before its fateful voyage.",

As birth rates plunge in rich countries, many politicians are keen to pour money into policies that might lead women to have more children. Yet all these attempts are likely to fail, because they are built on a misapprehension. The bulk of the decline in the fertility rate in such countries is among younger, poorer women who are delaying when they start to have children, and who therefore have fewer overall. Focusing on these women as a group would be bad for them and for society. Teenage pregnancies are linked to poverty and ill health for both mother and child. Targeted incentives would roll back decades of efforts to curb unwanted teenage pregnancy and encourage women into study and work. Most economies will therefore have to adapt to social change, and it falls to governments to smooth the way.",

One of the most powerful figures in philanthropy, Melinda French Gates, recently cut through the noise in an interview with Vanity Fair. Dismissing the supposed valor of executives who fill sleepless nights with work, French Gates calls the phenomenon “so dumb.” In shrugging off the CEO all-nighter, French Gates is also railing against the larger machismo and puritan ethos that praises at least pretending to work oneself to the bone. This past spring, French Gates left the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which she ran for more than 20 years with ex-husband and Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Departing with $12.5 billion under her wing, French Gates tweeted that it was time for her to move into the “next chapter” of her philanthropic journey. On her own, French Gates has wasted no time in carving her distinct path. She immediately donated $1 billion to women’s rights and reproductive rights groups, backed a presidential candidate for the first time, and called out other billionaires like Elon Musk for what she described as their lack of philanthropic efforts. That’s all to say: French Gates isn’t holding back. And when it comes to men who say they don’t sleep, she’s not shy about sharing her thoughts. Whether it be their ego or sleep deprivation, these men aren’t necessarily all that great to share a room with, French Gates tells Vanity Fair.

People who were morbidly obese or just slightly overweight suddenly saw the possibility that they could have the svelte body image they wanted. The market for these drugs is expected to reach $100 billion in 2030, after manufacturing finally catches up. Senator Bernie Sanders, no fan of pharmaceutical lobbyists, recently said that demand for these drugs could eventually bankrupt the Medicare program.

Already, research on the primary drivers of aging abounds.

It’s pet areas and happy hours. “Listings with a turfed pet area, coworking space or community happy hours are drawing more interest as renters appear to be prioritizing practical amenities and community-focused perks,” the analysis read. Completely understandable, in my mind. Who doesn’t love puppies and cocktails? For the analysis, Zillow looked at almost six million rental listings, from apartment complexes to single family homes, and found specific amenities that contributed to more saves and shares per day—a signal of demand, it said. To be clear, this isn’t a science, everyone likes different things. Still, “the most in-demand amenities are off-street parking and in-unit laundry,” according to Zillow. Listings with mentions of off-street parking received 85% more saves and 103% more shares; those with mentions of in-unit laundry received 76% more saves and 67% more shares per day. Of course, those two are somewhat necessary and practical. Fun comes after. Homes with pet-friendly spots resulted in 76% more daily saves and 91% shares; homes with air filtration mechanisms (less fun, but more or less practical in a post-pandemic world) got 72% more saves and 79% more shares; places that offer happy hours got 50% more saves and 67% shares; and rentals with coworking spaces got 16% more saves and 23% more shares.",

I remember the conversations when we were going from vinyl LP to eight-track to cassette tape to CD, and the trauma of thinking, “Oh, my goodness, it’s going to put us out of business.” I think the fear can come from the unknown.

Workforce planning missteps can result in reduced margins and degraded customer service. These workforce challenges affect more than three million people employed at the 40 top-grossing travel and logistics companies. About the authors This article is a collaborative effort by Jorge Amar, Neal Parikh, Sal Arora, Scott McConnell, and Taylor Cornwall, with Joseph Faucher, representing views from McKinsey’s Travel, Logistics & Infrastructure Practice. Companies have limited control over the future cost and availability of labor. But proper strategies can help maximize a frontline workforce’s productivity, ensuring the right number of employees are deployed to the right places at the right times. This can build resiliency to handle unexpected events. Across travel and logistics companies—such as airlines, hotels, logistics services providers, and others—significant value could be created through improved workforce management that simultaneously incorporates long-range, near-term, and day-to-day goals. Today’s challenges stem from decisions made over past decades. Although they are rich with data, many companies have underinvested in the foundations and optimization tools that would allow them to use that data to plan more effectively. With limited visibility, workforce planning is often driven by outdated assumptions and methods, frequently resulting in situations where complex workforces are managed using overly simple models and spreadsheets. The tools companies currently use often lack the precision and agility needed to handle today’s workforce complexities in an ever-changing operating environment. Newer solutions, such as generative AI (gen AI), can integrate large and disparate data sets to generate fresh capabilities and greater workforce agility.",

For Europe, McKinsey estimates that, by 2030, more than 300,000 public and private charge points will be required across the continent for medium- and heavy-duty trucks, up from roughly 10,000 today. The creation of this new infrastructure represents a significant challenge. Building out robust networks of chargers will require approximately €40 billion of capital investment until 2040. Of this, €7 billion of investments are needed until 2030, less than a quarter of which has been publicly committed today. It will also be energy-intensive, consuming 20 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity annually by 2030, roughly 0.5 percent of Europe’s total electricity demand. Gaining access to all this energy will often mean securing additional capacity on an already congested grid. At the same time, the possibilities are wide open. With no incumbent players fully established in the electric truck–charging market, companies from a variety of arenas have an opportunity to shape the ecosystem of market participants, creating new businesses or forging strategic collaborations.

Revenues have stagnated amid outflows from higher-fee active equity mutual funds and a period of adjustment in the private markets. And profitability has remained under pressure amid rising costs. The good news: lifted by strong market performance and healthier net flows, the industry’s global assets under management (AUM) reached a record $132 trillion as of June 2024. The bad news: 2023 revenues were essentially flat compared with the previous year and profits shrank 5 percent. Certain asset management companies have still been able to achieve above-market growth, but share gains amid stagnant industry economics only get organizations so far. Outsize growth needs to come from new pools of assets outside the industry. Fortunately, new opportunities are prevalent because of disruption and dislocation in the balance sheets of banks, insurance companies, and high-net-worth investors. By our estimates, these changes could bring the industry $8 trillion to $10 trillion of new managed assets over the next decade. This year’s report explores the following six themes:\n\nthe unevenness of the industry’s rebound from a weak 2022, with considerable variation across regions, channels, and product types\n\nthe nature of the revenue-neutral recovery of 2023, driven in large part by lower-priced investment strategies attracting the bulk of recovery inflows\n\nthe pressures on profitability, including the upward creep in the industry’s cost base, despite 2023 purportedly being “the year of austerity”\n\nthe shifting basis of competition as several of the largest asset managers continue to gain market share, and as the traditional focus on investment performance alone is no longer considered a surefire way to succeed\n\nan opportunity beyond the balance sheet—$8 trillion to $10 trillion that could be unlocked as banks, insurers, and individual high-net-worth investors restructure their allocations and holdings\n\na new agenda for not just surviving but thriving in this rapidly shifting market environment—an agenda that North American asset managers should consider over the next 12 to 18 months\n\nOur 2024 review of the industry shows an interesting dichotomy.",

At Salesforce’s recent Connections conference, Salesforce president and chief marketing officer Ariel Kelman and Jenna Posner, then the chief digital officer of Solo Brands, sat down with McKinsey partner Lisa Harkness to discuss how marketers can use a combination of technology and human insights to fuel growth and customer engagement. The following is an edited transcript of their conversation. Lisa Harkness: How are AI and gen AI playing a transformative role in the future of marketing, especially when it comes to customer experience? Ariel Kelman: If you look at the first wave of predictive AI, marketing was ahead of other parts of business, using machine learning models for things like scoring leads and defining segments.",

For centuries, philosophers have opined on the nature of control and the challenge of recognizing what’s in one’s power to change. Solving the problem of climate change—that is, achieving net zero in time to spare our planet the worst effects of a warming climate—will likely require all the wisdom (and strategic action) we can collectively muster. To meet this goal, we will need to minimize the emissions directly under our control. But also, we must reduce the emissions that do not result directly from our own activities. These are known as Scope 3 emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions are classified into three categories, or scopes. Organizations divide their emissions into these scopes to help them create effective reduction plans. What are Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions? Get to know and directly engage with senior McKinsey experts on emissions. Andrea Del Miglio is a senior partner in McKinsey’s Milan office; Fernando Perez is a senior partner in the Miami office; Jukka Maksimainen is a senior partner in the Helsinki office; Lucy Pérez is a senior partner in the Boston office; Mark Patel is a senior partner in the Bay Area office; Michel Van Hoey is a senior partner in the Luxembourg office; and Peter Spiller is a partner in the Frankfurt office. Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions are relatively straightforward. Scope 1 emissions are greenhouse gases that an organization emits from sources it owns or controls directly. In the case of an airplane manufacturer, this could include the emissions associated with fuel combustion in the planes it produces or the boiler or furnace in one of its corporate offices.",

McKinsey partner Emma Loxton interviewed Nikki Grady-Smith, chief transformation officer at Rolls-Royce, at the Farnborough International Airshow to discuss the company’s transformation, its midterm goals, and its long-term objectives. What follows is an edited version of that conversation. Emma Loxton: The chief-transformation-officer role can be quite varied. How do you think about it at Rolls-Royce? Nikki Grady-Smith: My portfolio obviously covers transformation; it also covers strategy and sustainability. I also have government relations, our regional teams, and our communications team, because engagement and communication through transformation are so critical, with all the stakeholders we need to engage. I also have procurement because we want to make a step change there from a transformation perspective. Emma Loxton: How do you think about balancing such a diverse portfolio? Nikki Grady-Smith: It’s always a challenge, but obviously it’s about having the right team. You can never do anything without the right team and the right strategy. So for me, it’s about prioritizing: “Where am I going to have the best personal impact? And where’s that priority for the organization that I need to be focusing on at any one moment in time?”\n\nBecause we need to make a step change in procurement, I am going to put a bit more of my personal time in there and make sure we’re driving that forward.

To keep pace with the current rate of adoption, the power needs of data centers are expected to grow to about 2.5 times higher than current capacity by the end of the decade, going from between 3 and 4 percent of total US power demand today to between 11 and 12 percent in 2030. Skyrocketing compute and data demands are being further accelerated by gains in computing capabilities alongside reductions in chip efficiency relative to power consumption. For instance, the amount of time central processing units need to double their performance efficiency has increased from every two years to nearly every three years. And providing the more than 50 gigawatts (GW) of additional data center capacity needed in the United States by the end of the decade would require an investment of more than $500 billion in data center infrastructure alone. About the authors This article is a collaborative effort by Alastair Green, Humayun Tai, Jesse Noffsinger, and Pankaj Sachdeva, with Arjita Bhan and Raman Sharma, representing views from McKinsey’s Electrical Power & Natural Gas; Technology, Media & Telecommunications; and Private Capital Practices. The power sector is rapidly becoming a protagonist in the AI story. Access to power has become a critical factor in driving new data center builds. As the power ecosystem grapples with meeting data centers’ voracious need for power, it faces substantial constraints, including limitations on reliable power sources, sustainability of power, upstream infrastructure for power access, power equipment within data centers, and electrical trade workers to build out facilities and infrastructure.",

        "text": "Quantum sensing, which allows sensors to collect data at the atomic level, is a tested technology. It has broad applications in commercial products (such as medical devices), in services (such as navigation), and as an enabler of internal processes (such as quality control)—and the technology is already usable. It enables many types of measurements that are currently too difficult to achieve, not precise enough, or simply unfeasible otherwise. Depending on the underlying technology, the size, weight, and power of the sensors enable a variety of use cases in different industries, making further deployment of quantum-computing sensors outside the lab possible. “Quantum sensors are reaching maturity levels that will allow us to run pilots in a wide range of environments and for a wide range of applications,” said Mathieu Munsch, CEO of quantum-sensing start-up Qnami. Most of the remaining hurdles are commercial and related to adoption—such as engineering and creating products, taking those products to market, building a supportive ecosystem, and managing the transition to using new tools. Because of these qualities, decision makers in many industries should have at least some familiarity with quantum sensing. This article provides an overview of the technology’s possible impact on industry as well as a look into the current state of the quantum-sensing ecosystem, highlighting ways companies could think about using the technology. Specifically, corporate stakeholders could investigate the costs and benefits of quantum-sensing use cases for themselves and their industries, set up their organizations to engage with the technology, and seek out partners with whom they could contribute to the quantum-sensing ecosystem. The road to commercialization may be relatively short, so the time to learn about and assess the technology is now.",

Historically, the industry has been driven by economic growth and the development of the middle class, resulting in major demand growth for materials such as steel, aluminum, and coal. While 80 percent of the industry today primarily consists of five materials—steel, coal, gold, copper, and aluminum—the landscape is rapidly changing as a result of the energy transition. Indeed, the energy transition is first and foremost a physical transformation and the key challenges are therefore mostly physical, including the timely availability of materials embedded in low-carbon technologies (as detailed in McKinsey Global Institute’s 2024 report, The hard stuff: Navigating the physical realities of the energy transition). The energy transition is changing the materials landscape in three ways:\n\nIt accelerates demand growth for materials that are embedded in low-carbon technologies as these technologies typically require more embedded materials than their conventional counterparts. For example, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are typically 15 to 20 percent heavier than comparable internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. It triggers a long-term shift of the materials demand profile as low-carbon technologies require a different set of energy transition materials, which is gradually increasing the relative importance of these materials in the overall metals and mining portfolio. It drives a long-term reduction of thermal coal in the energy system, currently the second largest material in metals and mining measured by revenue (2023). Key materials for the energy transition are crucial to achieve decarbonization in the global energy system—and a lack of sufficient and affordable supply would therefore risk hindering the at-speed deployment of crucial low-carbon technologies.",

The traditional truck ownership model of combining purchasing or leasing with selected add-on services is a proven model for both OEMs and customers. Large-fleet customers have a strong understanding of vehicle life cycles, including the expected residual value when vehicles leave their fleets. They know how to arrange for emergency engine repairs and are on a first-name basis with aftermarket agents. However, the shift to zero-emission (ZE) trucks—driven by regulatory requirements, long-term total-cost-of-ownership (TCO) benefits, and end-customer demand for greener products—will necessitate new business models for OEMs and other truck ecosystem participants. The transition is approaching now—EU regulators, for example, are calling for 45 percent reductions in road transport CO 2 emissions in 2030 compared to 2019. To reach regulatory decarbonization targets, 15 to 20 percent of new medium- and heavy-duty truck sales globally will have to be ZE by 2030. This profound shift will affect sources of growth and profits across the commercial vehicle ecosystem. Nearly half of industry profits in 2030 will come from opportunities beyond vehicle and aftermarket sales that do not exist today, McKinsey analysis suggests. OEMs can position themselves to capture this value by focusing on business models that encourage ZE adoption and improve margins. Although service bundles and solutions are already well established in the commercial vehicle ecosystem, the shift to ZE truck fleets (and, eventually, autonomous trucks) propels OEMs to offer a next-generation “truck as a service” (TaaS) business model. However, capturing this value can be risky for OEMs. Already, we have seen some OEMs lose market share because they have not offered the mix of services needed by their customers in different segments or have not priced them correctly.",

Organizational health has been linked to value creation, profitability, resilience, and safety metrics (see sidebar “How to assess organizational health”). How to assess organizational health The Organizational Health Index (OHI) is a diagnostic that measures critical elements of a high-performing culture in an organization. The index draws from a proprietary database of more than eight million respondents from more than 2,500 organizations across a range of geographies and industries. The index aggregates employees’ and managers’ views on the management practices and employee experiences that inform an organization’s performance across nine dimensions or outcomes. An overall score is assigned so companies can see how they compare with others in the database. The result is a detailed view of the health of an organization (exhibit). The insights presented in this article are based on OHI surveys deployed in two time periods: From 2014 to 2018, 982 surveys were deployed globally across sectors, including 11 surveys with 85,784 respondents at North American organizations in the care delivery sector. From 2019 to 2023, 712 surveys were deployed globally across sectors, including five surveys with 48,250 respondents at North American organizations in the care delivery sector. Organizations in the care delivery sector are no exception: those that prioritize and invest in building a healthy culture, even as they confront persistent internal and external pressures in the aftermath of the challenges of COVID-19 pandemic, are better positioned for success than those that do not.

Adopting these fuels marks a positive step toward sustainable commercial mobility but represents only an intermediate step toward zero-emission mobility in the commercial sector. Meanwhile, true zero-emission mobility in the form of electric or hydrogen-based trucking appears to be stuck in traffic as massive challenges delay adoption. About the authors This article is a collaborative effort by Anders Suneson, Anna Herlt, and Malte Hans, with Christian Begon and Henrik Becker, representing views from McKinsey’s Automotive & Assembly Practice and the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility. The transition to zero-emission trucks involves more than just replacing a powertrain. Disruptions will occur across the ecosystem: OEMs are devoting substantial development, production, and sales resources to developing new powertrains and higher degrees of digitization. A multibillion-dollar infrastructure challenge is on the horizon, and utility companies face a wave of new demand on their grids. In addition to those supply-side issues, fleets hesitate to commit to the transition in the face of challenges ranging from stretched capital expenditure budgets to unwieldy business cases to operational hurdles. Hitting regulatory targets: What would it take? The transition to zero-emission powertrains is largely driven by regulatory interventions and supported by decarbonization efforts across industries. Medium- and heavy-duty trucks (MHDTs) must become emission-free to decarbonize the transportation sector in line with long-term targets. To make this shift happen, regulators in the European Union and North America are following a two-pronged approach: first, they are pushing truck OEMs to decarbonize their product portfolios, and second, they are creating subsidy programs to bridge gaps in total cost of ownership (TCO) and ease capital expenditure burdens in infrastructure deployment.",

Their B2B customers are shifting toward consumer-like purchasing behavior. They’re also demanding a much more sophisticated buying experience and are willing to walk away if they don’t get it. In this ever-evolving environment, B2B decision makers are asking how they should continue to balance self-service (where they can manage buying on their own through a digital interface) and human interactions in their approach to sales. To find answers, we recently conducted our 2024 B2B Pulse Survey to better understand their priorities, expectations, and behaviors. We gathered responses from nearly 4,000 B2B decision makers across 34 sectors in eight major industries from 13 different countries. This year marks the ninth time that we have fielded this survey; since 2016, we have gathered insights from approximately 30,000 respondents globally. This year’s research shows that trends we’ve been tracking over the past several years have now crystallized into five fundamental truths about success in B2B sales and how these truths are experienced across three different archetypes of decision makers: adapters, innovators, and seekers. The “rule of thirds” rules all. At any given stage of the buying journey, one-third of customers hope for in-person interactions, one-third want remote communications, and one-third prefer digital self-serve options.

Since Boeing workers represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers' Union (IAM) walked off the job on Sept. 13, the workers and the company's shareholders have lost at least a combined $571 million, according to an analysis by Anderson Economic Group (AEG) — and the damages will only escalate as the strike drags on. Labor expert Jason Greer, founder of Greer Consulting, told FOX Business the strike will likely last another two to four weeks, but there are signs that it could extend beyond that timeframe. \"The striking employees are of the mindset that Boeing will have no choice but to give in to their demands considering how much money Boeing has already lost, in addition to how much they stand to lose the longer the strike lasts,\" he said.

New Census numbers show that real median income growth during Mr. Trump's pre-pandemic first three years compared to Joe Biden's — overall take-home pay for typical families — increased more than five-times as much under Mr. Trump than under Mr. Biden — up $6,040 for Trump, versus just $1,050 under Biden-Harris. When you break it down among key demographics, Mr. Trump's income numbers are almost 10-times better than Biden's. For example — now, stay with me on these numbers, folks — among Whites, real median income increased $8,910 under Trump, compared to a measly $850 under Biden. That's actually 10-and-a-half times more. THE FED CUT RATES BY HALF-POINT: WHAT TO KNOW\n\nAmong Asians, income increased $14,600 under Trump, versus a paltry $1,500 under Biden — about 10-times as much. For Hispanics, $6,960 under Trump, versus only $700 under Biden. Again, just about 10-times. Among Blacks, it was $4,540 under Mr. Trump, versus $2,650 under Biden. So, about double. This is one reason why Mr. Trump has been able to put together a working-class coalition, spanning all racial and ethnic groups. Remember, median income means that of all the incomes, this statistic captures the middle of the population, and these Census numbers adjust for inflation.

        "text": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that immigration is helping push the unemployment rate higher as they enter the labor force and look for jobs. Powell was asked about whether the level of job creation in the economy, which has been a little more than 100,000 on average for the last three months, is alarming and if the labor market can continue slowing down through fewer job openings as opposed to job losses. \"On the job creation… it depends on the inflows,\" Powell said. \"So if you're having millions of people come into the labor force, and you're creating 100,000 jobs, you're going to see unemployment go up. So it really depends on what's the trend underlying the volatility of people coming into the country.\" \"We understand there's been quite an influx across the borders , and that has actually been one of the things that's allowed the unemployment [rate] to rise. And the other thing is just the slower hiring rate, which is something we also watch carefully. So it does depend on what's happening on the supply side,\" he explained. THE FED CUT RATES BY HALF-POINT: WHAT TO KNOW\n\nThe unemployment rate has risen in recent months amid a slowdown in hiring. It reached 4% in May for the first time since January 2022 and hit 4.3% in July, before declining to 4.2% in August. Powell's comments come after the August jobs report showed a decline in employment among native-born workers while the number of employed foreign-born workers rose in the past year. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) noted that in the past 12 months through August, native-born American workers lost over 1.3 million jobs, while foreign-born workers gained more than 1.2 million jobs in that span.",

Powell explained during the post-meeting press conference that since the Fed's last meeting at the end of July, policymakers have received two employment reports and inflation reports apiece, as well as the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW). \"We've had the two employment reports , July and August. We've also had two inflation reports, including one that came in during blackout. We had the QCEW report which suggests… that the payroll report numbers that we're getting may be artificially high and will be revised down,\" Powell said. \"So we took all of those and we went into blackout and we thought about what to do, and we concluded that this was the right thing for the economy, for the people that we serve. And that's how we made our decision,\" he said of the process that led to the rate cut. THE FED CUT RATES BY HALF-POINT: WHAT TO KNOW\n\nThe Labor Department released the QCEW last month, which covered the 12-month period from April 2023 to March 2024 and showed a downward revision of 818,000 jobs to payroll figures for that period. It was the largest downward revision to payrolls in the report since 2009 and translated to 68,000 fewer jobs added per month over that period. The QCEW is preliminary and may undergo further changes when the annual adjustment is posted in February.",

However, a global workforce also brings a challenge: As some employees are getting up in the morning, others are winding down their workday. “There are many benefits to the individual and the company from embracing work-from-anywhere.”\n\nMismatched working hours makes it difficult for employees to connect, and even a one-hour schedule difference can hurt communication, introduce complexity, and potentially create new gender inequities, according to recent research by Prithwiraj Choudhury, the Lumry Family Associate Professor at Harvard Business School. “There are many benefits to the individual and the company from embracing work-from-anywhere,” Choudhury says. “But there are also challenges—and one of those is that when people are spread out across time zones, communication is affected.”\n\nAs the need for global collaboration accelerates and companies recalibrate their remote and hybrid arrangements, Choudhury and colleagues present the first real-time data on how different time zones affect employees’ ability to communicate in a paper published in Organizational Science in May. The team found that when work schedules clash, real-time communication drops, and some workers feel pressure to shift their work-related conversations to early or late periods of the day when they should be off the clock. Yet talking after hours can be especially tough for some employees, including women with caregiving responsibilities, as well as workers in countries with strict hourly limits, Choudhury says. Scheduling talks in multiple time zones\n\nDuring real-time, or synchronous, communication—including in-person meetings, video conferencing, phone calls, or instant messaging—employees exchange large amounts of information quickly and receive immediate feedback, including the cues that come from tone of voice and body language, the researchers say.",

But despite the availability of Slack, internal newsletters, and virtual town hall meetings, organizations can still go quiet. One of the most common culprits: Major leadership transitions, according to a recent study of 500 million emails and 80 million meeting invitations. Shortly after a new CEO takes over, uncertainty among employees dampens communication within a company. However, after about five months, internal chatter sharply intensifies as managers start rolling out the leader’s new strategic game plan, according to research by Harvard Business School Professor Raffaella Sadun. “A CEO transition is a major organizational event, and communication inside the company is such an important aspect of that transition.”\n\nSadun and colleagues describe how a CEO’s arrival creates dramatic shifts in internal communication levels in their paper, “Communication Within Firms: Evidence From CEO Turnovers,” published in Management Science. And when corporate communication breaks down, it can lead to confusion and stress, low morale, delayed projects, and lost sales. Case in point: Ron Johnson’s brief but tumultuous tenure from 2011 to 2013 at JCPenney, where messages from top executives were so murky, the retail company was described as a place where “communication goes to die,” the researchers write, leading to rumors and distrust within the firm. “A CEO transition is a major organizational event, and communication inside the company is such an important aspect of that transition,” says Sadun, who provides advice for avoiding communication shutdowns. Sadun, the Charles E. Wilson Professor of Business Administration at HBS, conducted the research with Stephen Michael Impink, an assistant professor of Strategy at HEC Paris, and Andrea Prat, a professor of business at Columbia Business School.",

An experimental artificial intelligence (AI) mentor designed to answer business questions from Kenyan entrepreneurs helped some become more successful—but led others down the wrong path, says Rembrand Koning, the Mary V. and Mark A. Stevens Associate Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School. How much strategic insight and profit boost AI can provide depends on the condition of a business at the onset of the study. \"Already we’re seeing how generative AI can change people's lives.\" Businesses that were already financially stable used the AI-generated advice to produce measurable improvements, while struggling businesses ran into further difficulties, say Rembrand and collaborators Rowan Clarke, a doctoral student at HBS; Solène Delecourt and David Holtz, assistant professors at the University of California, Berkeley; and Berkeley doctoral student Nicholas G. Otis. While Koning describes the paradoxical outcomes as a “real puzzle,” he believes the study offers encouraging findings about AI’s capabilities to help solve business problems, particularly in parts of the world with fewer resources and less access to technology. “The fact that generative AI was a little over a year old, and we could use it to advise several hundred Kenyan entrepreneurs how to improve their businesses blows my mind,” Koning says. “Already we’re seeing how generative AI can change people’s lives.”\n\nChatbot versus an old-fashioned business guide\n\nThe study enrolled 640 entrepreneurs in Kenya across various sectors, including transportation, food, clothing, jewelry, cosmetics, construction, carpentry, and agriculture.",

With costs poised to drop and innovation on the rise, the economics of cosmic exploration and commerce are rapidly changing. Harvard Business School Senior Associate Dean Matthew Weinzierl’s new research explores the business opportunities hidden among the stars, particularly in data from and through space, but also in tourism, manufacturing, and even space-based resources. “From national security to climate change observation and trying to fix some of the biggest problems on Earth, the space economy is now interwoven in our everyday lives,” says Weinzierl, who is also the Joseph and Jacqueline Elbling Professor of Business Administration. HBS Working Knowledge caught up with Weinzierl to find out what investors should consider in the short term and long term as they think about the future of the space economy. This conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Baskin: What are the highest-growth areas in the space economy? Weinzierl: What’s really interesting about what’s happening in space is the fundamental transformation of how it’s being organized. For a long time, when most people thought about what we do in space as humans, they thought of it as primarily a government-led activity. They thought of the James Webb telescope, the International Space Station, or the space shuttle. “If you look at the area of space getting the most attention―manufacturing of launch vehicles and satellites―its growth is in fact quite strong.”\n\nWhat’s changed over the past couple decades is that the government-led model, which served us extremely well back in the 1960s, has been revolutionized by bringing in market forces in a way that they never were before.",

With committed funding and strong research and development (R&D) investments, NSPL is dedicated to addressing the space-based Earth observation needs of Indian stakeholders while building the first private satellite constellation in India. Today, India relies on a limited number of sovereign satellites and expensive foreign satellite imagery that does not meet the evolving national security needs. To address this shortfall, NSPL is undertaking a groundbreaking initiative to establish a private, domestic all-weather low Earth observation satellite constellation, consisting of 40 satellites over the next five to six years. This constellation will offer high-resolution imagery, high revisit times, and an end-to-end turnkey solution for national defence and strategic interests. NSPL will offer this constellation to end users on a leased or user-definable exploitation model. Dignitaries attending the event, including Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari, highlighted the strategic importance of this venture for India’s defence and space sectors. They applauded NSPL for driving self-reliance and technological advancement. “I am proud to see NSPL’s plans to establish India’s first multi-sensor, all-weather, high-revisit Earth observation satellite constellation and related ground stations.",

Its latest research report, Food Delivery Unwrapped: Uncovering Hidden Costs on India's Aggregator Platforms, based on the analysis of data across three major platforms -- Swiggy, Zomato, and magicpin -- sheds light on the price inflation and hidden costs embedded in food aggregator services, including delivery fees, packaging charges, and the marginal utility of premium subscriptions like Zomato Gold.

Inflation in July was 2.04 per cent. In August last year, WPI inflation was (-) 0.46 per cent. \"Positive rate of inflation in August 2024 is primarily due to an increase in prices of food articles, processed food products, other manufacturing, manufacture of textiles and manufacture of machinery & equipment etc,\" the Commerce and Industry Ministry said in a statement. Inflation in food items was 3.11 per cent in August against 3.45 per cent in July. This was led by declining prices of vegetables, which dropped 10.01 per cent in August. Inflation in potatoes and onions continued to be high at 77.96 per cent and 65.75 per cent, respectively, in August. Barclays in a note said the slowing in August WPI was driven by a sequential decline in food (vegetable) prices. The continued climb in non-perishable food prices needs to be watched. ICRA senior economist Rahul Agrawal said while Kharif sowing has been healthy so far, the surplus rainfall in the ongoing month can potentially delay the Kharif harvesting and/or impact such yields, even as reasonably healthy reservoir storage at pan-India level is likely to boost the sowing of rabi crops. \"The WPI inflation eased to a four-month low of 1.3 per cent in August 2024, with the fuel and power, core (non-food manufacturing), and crude petroleum and natural gas sub-groups together pulling down the headline WPI print by as much as 70 bps in the month vis-à-vis July 2024,\" Agrawal said.",

The Fed lowered its interest rate for the first time in four years to 4.75-5% amid a cooling labour market and easing inflation rates.\n\nThe Fed is also expected to systematically cut rates to about 250 bps till 2026.\n\nWith this move, the India currency has appreciated with respect to the US Dollar to about Rs 83.69.\n\nTalking to BT about the impact on Indian economy, experts said that RBI monetary policy will be a function of domestic inflation. Dharmakirti Joshi, Chief Economist at CRISIL said, “Even though RBI monetary policy is dependent on US Fed Reserve, a lot will depend on CPI rates. Once CPI rates are in check only then can we see RBI going ahead with any rate cuts. The situation will be clear after monsoon season ends.” He also said that currency rate will have impact the export income and excess appreciation of currency can dent export incomes.\n\nMadan Sabnavis, Chief Economist, Bank of Baroda said that rate cuts didn’t come as a big surprise to the Indian markets and some effect was seen on the currency rates and a minor effect on bond yields. He also assured that RBI’s policy will be majorly dependent on the domestic factors like CPI and US Fed will majorly impact the currency rates.\n\nSpeaking about the long-term growth of the economy, Joshi said that the Indian economy is likely to be growing and a rise in per capita income is also expected as GDP increases and population growth plateaus.\n\nSabnavis added that the per capita income will grow when employment opportunities are created in organised sectors and focus is given to the quality of growth.\n\nVG",

High income, urban Indians, often living in elite addresses and gated societies are often not cooperating in surveys and declining to provide information. This lack of cooperation is a major stumbling block, which distorts the statistical sample for conducting household surveys and in turn impacts policymaking and decisions. “Decision making needs to be data based. Policy needs to be evidence based, and if we don’t have the correct data, if we don’t have the right evidence then perhaps the policies or the decisions that are taken may also reflect the skewed data. Household surveys form a very important part of the data that is collected,” said Saurabh Garg, Secretary Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation on Friday at a brainstorming session on the issue, which was organised by the NSSO and MoSPI. It was also attended by top officials of the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) and representatives from Residents Welfare Associations (RWAs) and gated societies. He noted that there are several concerns about data privacy when it comes to providing information to field officers of the NSSO but underlined that this data remains anonymous. He also said that the ministry is undertaking a number of reforms to ensure that there is no survey fatigue in terms of the time taken for these interviews. “There are a number of reforms that we are undertaking in the ministry of statistics, and some of them include how to ensure that there is no fatigue in terms of the survey time,” he said, adding that this is being done by breaking the data collection into one or two sessions, using technology for computer-aided personal interviews instead of paper-based surveys and improving representativeness of these surveys.",

A new report by economic think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) says this is incorrect, pointing out that several countries impose high tariffs on various products to protect their domestic industry. “While India needs serious tariff reforms, the label of ‘Tariff King’ does not hold up when compared to the tariff practices of the USA and other major economies,” said the report, which has analysed import duties levied by India and the US. It has suggested that the US should consider signing a free trade agreement with India if it is keen on zero tariffs but has noted that the US has had a cautious approach even in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, where no tariff cuts were included. “India has already removed tariffs on most imports from its FTA partners like ASEAN, Japan, and South Korea, showing its openness to free trade. However, despite India's willingness, the U.S. has been reluctant to reduce tariffs through FTAs,” said the report by Ajay Srivastava, Founder, GTRI. Former US President and Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump had recently called India \"an abuser\" of import tariffs, a claim that echoed his October 2020 statement labelling India the ‘Tariff King’. The report conceded that while it is true that India imposes high duties on select products, it said that Trump’s argument overlooks essential context, making his accusations unfair. “Trump does not talk about average tariffs but singles out products with the highest tariffs charged by India,” it said.",

However, the silence of my people on the ground in Springfield who have been enduring bomb threats has been deafening. Why aren’t they speaking up? Even as I took to social media to finally speak my sadness and fear, I was reminded of my experience as an immigrant child coming to the US from Haiti, quickly learning English to translate our native Haitian Kreyol.

Williams Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School, where he co-leads the Climate and Sustainability Impact Lab in the Digital Data Design Institute. Two years ago, the CEO of storied car manufacturer BMW found himself facing a quandary. How fast and how much should the company shift its product portfolio toward climate solutions—namely, electric vehicles (EVs)—in the face of regulatory, customer, investor, and employee pressure? To some, the answers are simple: today and 100%. BMW’s CEO, Oliver Zipse, saw the decision as more complicated, bound up with multiple factors. Could BMW deliver an EV with design and performance worthy of the company’s promise to engineer a superior driving experience? Could the company sell such an EV at a price its customers could afford? Would an extended charging network and a sufficiently robust electric grid be developed to serve EV owners? Could BMW secure a steady supply of EV materials and components, amid volatile markets for such commodities as lithium and cobalt? And would an electric BMW represent a genuine climate solution, a model that produces fewer carbon emissions over its life cycle than a comparable gas-powered car? Many of these considerations gave the CEO pause. Several were commercial. It wasn’t clear that BMW customers were ready to hunt for charging stations, put up with lengthy charging times, pay a premium for EVs—or give up the thrill of hearing a gasoline engine growl and roar. Nor could BMW count on being able to source batteries at a reasonable cost. Environmental factors also arose.",

Since it took to the skies in 1932, India’s oldest airline has had a circuitous flight. Founded by J.R.D. Tata, the first Indian to earn a commercial pilot license, the former Tata Airlines was rechristened Air India in 1946, the same year it became a public company. Nationalization followed in 1953, accompanied by a monopoly on domestic air travel that lasted until the early 1990s. In 2021, amid mounting financial losses, came privatization and a homecoming: the US$2.3 billion acquisition by Tata Group. After more than 70 years of government ownership, the task of turning Air India into a modern, competitive business has fallen to Campbell Wilson. The 53-year-old New Zealander joined as CEO shortly after privatization, following a career with Singapore Airlines that included founding Scoot, its low-cost carrier, and serving a stint as group senior vice president of sales and marketing. Two years into Wilson’s tenure, the airline’s reinvention is taking shape. Air India has delivered 2.5 times revenue growth in this period, and revenue at low-cost subsidiary Air India Connect is up almost 1.5 times. A recruitment drive has lowered the average age of non-flying staff by 20 years—without layoffs—and overdue investments being made in aircraft and information technology present an opportunity to leapfrog competitors after years of falling behind. Tata Group has also moved strategically to reshape the competitive landscape by combining its airline holdings, first in the low-cost segment through the merger of AirAsia India into Air India Express, and then in the full-service segment through the proposed merger of Air India with Vistara, its joint venture with Singapore Airlines.",

That efficiency results in lower barriers to entry, because start-ups do not need to raise capital to wait out a prolonged license approval process (or build a substantial compliance team) before they start generating revenue.\n\n“For existing banks and financial institutions without sophisticated digital-first offerings, BaaS provides a way to monetize existing infrastructure, regulatory licenses, and risk-management expertise by extending those services to customer-facing distribution partners in return for fees,” says Akhilesh Khera, a partner in PwC UK’s digital banking practice. “This allows existing banks to reach new customer segments, diversify revenue streams, and generate additional income.”\n\nFintech companies with expertise in infrastructure and technology can draw on BaaS to grow a banking business while dispensing with end customer–facing activity altogether. Companies such as Solaris, ClearBank, and Stripe, for example, have generated significant revenues in a short space of time by providing banking products to customer-facing banks and neobanks without seeking to market those products directly to end users.\n\nBaaS encourages diversity in banking provision by allowing new companies to rapidly launch products while focusing on their core competencies, such as user experience or customer service.

Just recently, filmmaker and actor Tyler Perry halted a US$800 million expansion of his production studio after seeing a preview of OpenAI’s video generator, Sora. The industry could soon move toward highly personalized content creation, where AI generates content based on individual viewer preferences. Although such customization at scale may present initial challenges, it could fundamentally alter how entertainment is produced and consumed. Marketing services is another area likely to face significant change for many of the same reasons as the entertainment industry. GenAI-powered tools for marketing were among the first generation of GenAI applications available. The market is flooded with young vendors in this space and is likely to see significant consolidation in the coming months as a result. Established incumbents such as Salesforce are increasingly incorporating generative AI into their existing products as well. As in entertainment, video- and music-generation tools will offer significant cost savings for marketing services. Another similarity: the personalization that the cost and speed of generative AI enables is among the use cases offering the most transformational value, and its impact is still nascent. GenAI could even bring about a disintermediation of marketing services due to the leverage it provides to the companies they currently serve. More significant disruption could be on the horizon as the move toward agentic systems, which act autonomously on a user’s or organization’s behalf, accelerates. One example of these signals comes in the form of a startup called Firsthand, which was founded by adtech luminaries who developed some of today’s online advertising platforms.

But it appears that bad reputation may be undeserved. Chocolate has long had a reputation for causing spots. Is there any truth to it? Or is it just something parents tell their kids to avoid shelling out on sweet treats at the supermarket? In the 1960s, several studies analysed the relationship between chocolate and acne. The biggest study – which only recruited 65 participants – found no relationship between the two. But this study has since been criticised for having numerous design flaws. While chocolate may be off the hook, more recent studies suggest that there could, in fact, be many connections between diet and acne – particularly the Western diet, which is high in saturated fat, sugar and dairy. Acne is a common skin condition where hair follicles in the skin become blocked by oil and dead skin cells, which causes spots to form. Severe or persistent acne from adolescence and adulthood is mostly caused by genetics, says Beibei Du-Harpur, dermatologist and clinical lecturer at Kings College London. This is because our genes determine the size of our skin's sebaceous glands, which produce oil. Getty Images Severe acne in adolescents is much more likely to be the result of genetics than diet, experts suggest (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nCases of adult acne have been on the rise in recent years, especially in women, but there's no one single reason for this, says Du-Harpur.

He told Cialdini that he would be missing out on a unique sale that would only last for that weekend. He emphasised the fact that the top pundits rated the magazine very highly. And he casually mentioned that he'd already sold a lot of subscriptions to the other dormmates. Cialdini soon gave in. When the man had left, he leant back against the door and took stock of what had just happened. \"I thought, 'You spent your money, and it wasn't because of the merits of the thing – it was the way he presented it,'\" Cialdini recalls. \"And I thought, 'Isn't that interesting? Isn't that worth studying?'\" Cialdini's curiosity would lead him to write Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion, published in 1984.

New York Governor Kathy Hochul was clear about her opinion of social media earlier this month, speaking at a press conference to announce the signing of two new state laws designed to protect under-18-year-olds from the dangers the online world. The apps are responsible for transforming \"happy-go-lucky kids into teenagers who are depressed\", she said, but according to Hochul, the legislation she signed off on would help. \"Today, we save our children,\" Hochul said. \"Young people across the nation are facing a mental health crisis fuelled by addictive social media feeds.\" Starting in 2025, these new laws could force apps including TikTok and Instagram to send some children back to the earliest days of social media, before content was tailored by users' \"likes\" and tech giants collected data about our interests, moods, habits and more. The Stop Addictive Feeds Exploitation (SAFE) for Kids Act requires social media platforms and app stores seek parental consent before children under 18 use apps with \"addictive feeds\", a groundbreaking attempt to regulate algorithmic recommendations. The SAFE Act will even prevent apps from sending notifications to child or teenage users between midnight and 6am – practically a legal bedtime for devices – and require better age verification to avoid children slipping through undetected. The second law, the New York Child Data Protection Act, limits the information app providers collect about their users.",

To adapt to more destructive hurricanes, typhoons and tropical cyclones, we need to know how they're changing. Fuelled by heat from ocean waters, hurricanes, typhoons and tropical cyclones are sometimes known as nature's steam engines. As they barrel over the oceans, they turn its heat into brutal kinetic energy that flattens islands and inundates coastal cities, taking months of urgent repair work to heal. Ocean temperatures are now breaking all records, and these \"engines\" are responding accordingly, cutting different paths across the ocean, slowing down, and becoming less predictable and more dangerous. Now there's a race to understand exactly how hurricanes are rewriting the rules and patterns we've seen before, in the hope of learning how we can adapt. A longer season\n\nThere's a distinct seasonal cycle to hurricanes in the Atlantic, with very few or none at all in winter, and a peak in September. A strong, early start to the hurricane season is in line with what we would expect with climate change, says James Kossin, a climate and atmospheric scientist retired from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa).

Well, it turns out those bacteria have viruses that exist in and around them – with important consequences for both them and us. Meet the phageome. There are billions, perhaps even trillions of these viruses, known as bacteriophages (\"bacteria eaters\" in Greek) or just \"phages\" to their friends, inside the human digestive system. Phageome science has skyrocketed recently, says Breck Duerkop, a bacteriologist at the University of Colorado Anschutz School of Medicine, and researchers are struggling to come to grips with their enormous diversity. Researchers suspect that if physicians could harness or target the right phages, they might be able to improve human health. \"There will turn out to be good phages as well as bad phages,\" says Paul Bollyky, an infectious disease physician and researcher at Stanford Medicine. But for now, it's still not clear how many phages occupy the gut – perhaps one for each bacterial cell, or even fewer. There are also bacteria that contain phage genes but aren't actively producing viruses – the bacteria are just living their lives with phage DNA tagging along in their genomes. And there are lots of phages still unidentified. Scientists call these the \"dark matter\" of the phageome. A big part of current phage research is to identify these viruses and their host bacteria.",

The problem of filling a plane with identical tiles has been so thoroughly explored since antiquity that it’s tempting to suppose that there is nothing left to be discovered about it. But the researchers deduced the principles of tilings with a new set of geometric building blocks that have rounded corners, which they term ‘soft cells’. ‘Geometry can be very simple, but totally deep’: meet top maths prizewinner Claire Voisin\n\n“Simply, no one has done this before”, says Chaim Goodman-Strauss, a mathematician at the National Museum of Mathematics in New York City, who was not involved in the work. “It’s really amazing how many basic things there are to consider.”\n\nIt has been known for millennia that only certain types of polygonal tile, such as squares or hexagons, can be packed together to fill 2D space with no gaps. Tilings that fill space without a regularly repeating arrangement, such as Penrose tilings, have attracted interest since the discovery of non-periodic structures called quasicrystals in the 1980s. Last year, the first quasiperiodic tiling, lacking any true periodicity, that uses just a single tile shape was announced by Goodman-Strauss and his colleagues2.

Researchers are anxiously awaiting data from the midwestern state about a mysterious bird flu infection in a person who had no known contact with potential animal carriers of the disease.

Hadron colliders offer a truly relativistic environment and provide a rich variety of fundamental interactions, rarely considered for experiments in quantum information. Relativistic effects are expected to play a critical part in quantum information17 and the measurement described here illustrates the potential for new approaches to explore these effects and other foundational problems in quantum mechanics using colliders. Recently, the heaviest fundamental particle known to exist, the top quark, was proposed as a new laboratory to study quantum entanglement and quantum information18,19. In this Article, the spin correlation between the top quark and antitop quark is used to probe the effects of quantum entanglement, in proton–proton (pp) collision events recorded with the ATLAS detector with a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. Entanglement is observed with a significance of more than five standard deviations for the first time in pairs of quarks. If two particles are entangled, the quantum state of one particle cannot be described independently of the other. The simplest example of an entangled system involves a pair of quantum bits (qubits); pieces of quantum information about two particles in the same quantum state that exist in superposition.

The result could lead to fresh insight about one of the forces holding nuclei together. If two particles are entangled, the quantum mechanical state of each particle cannot be described independently of that of the other. Entanglement has been observed several times1–4 and is key to developments in quantum computing and quantum cryptography. In a paper in Nature, the ATLAS Collaboration5 reports the detection of entanglement between a top quark and its antiparticle, the anti-top quark, at CERN, the European particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland. The observation is not unexpected. Indeed, it would have been a huge surprise to find that the pair wasn’t entangled. But to observe entanglement at such high energies is an astonishing feat — all the more so because it was detected in a pair of quarks, the fundamental particles making up all atomic nuclei. Read the paper: Observation of quantum entanglement with top quarks at the ATLAS detector\n\nThe team’s observation was made using CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which accelerates particles to extraordinary velocities, colliding them with each other and detecting the products. The LHC produces top-quark pairs (each comprising a particle and an antiparticle) by smashing protons into each other with a total collision energy of 13 teraelectronvolts (1 TeV is 1012 eV) — meaning that their kinetic energy is around 6,500 times larger than their energy at rest. A typical experiment1,2 to observe entanglement in an ordinary physics laboratory might use photons with wavelengths of a few hundred nanometres, so the energy scales are around a few electronvolts — about one trillion times smaller than those achieved at the LHC.",

So in 2021, he pivoted to neuroscience with the aim of building optical technologies to understand the brain. Last year, another opportunity turned Carolan’s head. The UK government was setting up a high-risk research funding agency. It was modelled on the famed US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, which helped to pioneer some of the world’s most consequential technologies, including the Internet and personal computers. The UK version, the Advanced Research and Invention Agency (ARIA), aimed to mimic that success, except that it avoids DARPA’s connection to military research. ARIA sought its inaugural programme directors with a seductive application question: if you had £50 million in research funding to change the world, what would you do? Carolan applied, highlighting his interest in developing technologies to treat neurological disorders. He is now one of the first eight programme directors at ARIA, where he has unusual freedom to select the projects that receive money from a 4-year, £800-million (US$1-billion) budget. “It’s been a wild journey,” says Carolan. US agency launches experiments to find innovative ways to fund research\n\nFunders and scientists around the world are watching to see whether ARIA can succeed in one of the most difficult challenges in science — working out how to spur researchers to develop truly revolutionary innovations.

Many researchers think that science policy is a total snoozefest. They imagine policy workers churning out boring white papers that sit idly at the bottom of a drawer, never to be read. But behind the scenes at United Nations assemblies and legislative agencies, science-policy specialists know their work will be put to the test. They brief global leaders at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, on breakthrough technologies and present the White House’s climate agenda to the press, the public and government agencies. They work out how funding agencies can award research grants to a more diverse pool of scientists, and help emerging economies to reduce carbon emissions without their compromising development. Whatever the form, crafting science policies is important and rewarding work, say four science-policy specialists interviewed by Nature. But there are challenges: getting on the radar of policymakers, for one. Another is building trust with government officials at the early stages of policymaking rather than only at moments of crisis. Still, scientists say that developing, advising on or advocating for policy contributes to social progress in tangible, measurable ways.

A potential solution to this problem has been developed: small molecules that help displaced proteins catch a ride with other proteins to return to their proper location. A network of biological regulators in the cell directs proteins to their appropriate cellular compartments. Disruptions to protein localization underlie various diseases, such as cancers and neurological disorders1. Writing in Nature, Ng et al.2 report small molecules that can relocate misplaced proteins by facilitating interactions with ‘shuttle’ proteins that move the misplaced protein between the cell cytoplasm and nucleus. Read the paper: Targeted protein relocalization via protein transport coupling\n\nConventional small-molecule drugs interact with a target protein to alter its activity. However, the activities of many therapeutically relevant proteins cannot be modified using small molecules that simply bind to the protein. In the past few years, many researchers have focused on small molecules that bring such proteins into close proximity with another biomolecule to gain further therapeutic traction. This concept has inspired the development of compounds that exert a biological effect by causing target proteins to be degraded by the cell3,4, by inducing DNA transcription5 or by stabilizing interactions between proteins6, among other mechanisms7. These efforts have been facilitated by linking together pairs of small ligand molecules — one ligand to bind to the target protein, and the other to bind to a biomolecule that has a desired function (Fig. 1). The resulting bifunctional molecules thereby bring the target protein and the biomolecule together. Ng et al. report a fresh take on this approach: a series of compounds termed targeted relocalization activating molecules (TRAMs), which shift the subcellular localization of target proteins.",

The question\n\nAs an embryo begins to form, its first cell-fate decisions establish the foundations for the proper development and well-being of the animal. During the process of gastrulation, the embryo breaks its initial symmetry and the basic body plan is laid out. At the same time, progenitor cells rapidly diversify to form distinct tissues. Embryonic organization thus entails coordinated transformation of this small number of cells, a process that requires each cell to sense, react to and interact with others in a constantly changing environment1. Surprisingly, this complex communication is performed by a small number of signalling pathways acting in close proximity2. We asked how the embryonic cells decode very similar signals to mean different things, on their way to forming the diverse tissues of the complete animal. The solution\n\nThe protein BMP4 is a key mouse developmental morphogen — a signalling molecule that produces growth responses in distant cells according to its concentration. To refine the roles of BMP4 in embryonic development, we developed a general model of how mouse gastrulation happens over time, with continuous and parallel cell differentiation both in the embryo and in its supporting external tissues (the extra-embryonic tissues), such as the placenta.",

In Bangladesh, a major difficulty in the fight against AMR is the lack of data on which bacteria are infecting whom, on how the various strains respond (or not) to which antibiotics and on how decisions are made about which drugs to use. Stop delaying action on antimicrobial resistance — it is achievable and affordable\n\nBangladesh’s health-care system is unusual in that most people receive treatment in community clinics, diagnostic centres and pharmacies rather than in hospitals. People tend to go to hospitals only when treatment obtained from these other places fails.",

Hello Nature readers, would you like to get this Briefing in your inbox free every day? Sign up here. Credit: Spyros Lytras and Joe Grove\n\nProtein structures predicted by AI models have revealed some twists in the evolution of flaviviruses — a group that includes hepatitis C, dengue and Zika viruses. Researchers used DeepMind’s AlphaFold2 and Meta’s ESMFold to generate more than 33,000 predicted structures for proteins from 458 flavivirus species. They already uncovered some surprises. For example, the hepatitis C virus infects cells using an entry system similar to one seen in the pestiviruses — a group that includes animal pathogens like swine fever. Another big surprise was the discovery that some flaviviruses have an enzyme that seems to have been stolen from bacteria.

New figures show there have been 715 locally acquired cases of West Nile virus across 15 European countries this year. Climate change is creating cosy conditions for Culex pipiens and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in places they couldn’t previously thrive, extending their range and the transmission period of the diseases they carry. “We are faced with a problem where new places could become hotspots of transmission that were not prepared for this before,” says genetic epidemiologist Houriiyah Tegally.

Each time she left the house, she ran through a mental checklist: did she have her pain medications? What was her energy level? Would she be able to make it through the day? Jones, who lives in Grand Prairie, Texas, longed to be free from the constant threat of a severe pain crisis or a stroke. So, in 2020, she opted for the only potential cure at the time: a transplant of blood stem cells from a donor without the disease. She spent six months preparing for the procedure, including weeks of radiation, chemotherapy and a lengthy hospital stay to destroy her own blood stem cells and make room for cells donated by her mother. The procedure cured her sickle-cell disease, and she is grateful. “It’s great to have that pain and anxiety lifted,” she says. “But it’s not the end of the story.”\n\nLess than one month after her transplant, Jones learnt that she had cancer, a known risk of the treatment. Three more rounds of chemotherapy and other treatments drove her cancer into remission, but she still struggles with chronic pain in her back and legs caused by decades of tissue and nerve damage from sickle-cell disease. And she worries that signs of mild cardiac inflammation mean that her new stem cells are making immune cells that are attacking her heart. Then there are the mental-health consequences. Jones’s treatment alienated her from the sickle-cell-disease support networks she had come to rely on, even though she was still wrestling with the consequences of the condition.",

Based on recent calculations, mathematicians have described a new classification they now call a “soft cell.” In its most basic form, soft cells take the form of geometric building blocks with rounded corners capable of interlocking at cusp-like corners to fill a two- or three-dimensional space. And if you think this concept is surprisingly rudimentary, you aren’t alone. “Simply, no one has done this before,” Chaim Goodman-Strauss, a mathematician at the National Museum of Mathematics not affiliated with the work, said of the classification to Nature on September 20. “It’s really amazing how many basic things there are to consider.”\n\n[Related: How to prove the Earth is round.] Experts have understood for thousands of years that specific polygonal shapes such as triangles, squares, and hexagons can arrange to cover a 2D plane without any gaps. In the 1980’s, however, researchers discovered structures such as Penrose tilings capable of filling a space without regularly repeating arrangements. Building on these and other geometry advances, a team led by Gábor Domokos at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics recently began exploring these concepts in more detail. This included a reexamination of “periodic polygonal tilings,” and the concept of what might happen if some corners are rounded. The results, published in the September issue of PNAS Nexus, reveal what Domokos and colleagues describe as soft cells—rounded forms capable of filling a space entirely thanks to specific corners deformed into “cusp shapes.” These cusps feature an internal angle of zero with edges meeting tangentially to fit into other rounded corners.",

While Meta and Google are exploring modern geothermal tech and other newer experimental energy sources, Microsoft is stepping back in time. This week, the company signed a 20-year-deal to source energy from the storied Three Mile Island nuclear facility in Pennsylvania, a site once known for the worst reactor accident in US history. If successful, the effort would breathe life back into the iconic symbol of US nuclear power and potentially provide Microsoft with around 800 megawatts of clean-burning energy to help satiate its growing energy appetite. “This agreement is a major milestone in Microsoft’s efforts to help decarbonize the grid in support of our commitment to become carbon negative,” Microsoft VP of Energy Bobby Hollis, said in a statement. Three Mile Island, located around two hours west of Philadelphia, altered the trajectory of US nuclear power adoption 45 years ago. Before sunrise on March 28, 1979, the facility’s Unit 2 reactors partially melted down, releasing some radioactive gas into the air sending the nearby area into a panic. While there were no recorded deaths following the meltdown, the incident dealt lasting damage to the public perception of nuclear energy. Now, many environmental scientists and researchers argue the backlash may have been overblown. Nuclear is considered a clean energy source since it does not create greenhouse gas emissions (though it does create nuclear waste). It’s also more dependable than renewables like solar and wind. That always-on availability is attractive for tech companies like Microsoft that will need all the power they can muster to keep their data center running and properly cooled.",

When the strike ended, actors were awarded new, hard-won protections against AI-generated clones. Since then, California has passed several landmark laws limiting Hollywood’s use of certain generatrice AI use cases. But none of those efforts will outright stop major studios from using generative AI to try and cut costs around new movies and shows.

Most waves are not unidirectional; they’re not just moving across a two-dimensional plane, as described in many current models. Scientists studying the waves’ three-dimensional properties have observed that waves moving in more than one direction at once can grow twice as steep before they break and even reach heights that are four times steeper than previously believed. These waves even continue to get steeper after breaking, when waves usually tend to dissipate. The findings are described in a study published September 18 in the journal Nature. Cross seas\n\nOur understanding of how waves break has primarily been models of unidirectional waves. They roll outwards, form a crest, and then break. However, ocean waves can actually travel in many directions and they can rarely fit into this simplified two-dimensional model. [Related: Huge 60-foot-tall buoy uses ocean waves to create clean energy.] “Whether we want it or not, water waves are more often three-dimensional than two-dimensional in the real world,” Frederic Dias, a study co-author and mathematician from University College Dublin and ENS Paris-Saclay, said in a statement. “In 3D, there are more ways in which waves can break.”\n\n3D ocean waves have more complex movements. They form when waves are all coming in from different directions and shoot vertically instead of solely horizontal and then cresting. The most extreme kind of 3D waves are generated when wave systems are “crossing.” These “cross seas” occur when wave systems meet one another or when winds suddenly change direction, such as in a hurricane.",

Even after 2,600 years’ worth of tiny shocks, however, researchers couldn’t fully explain how rubbing two objects together causes it. But according to a team at Northwestern University, the mystery is finally solved. As explained in a September 17 study published in the journal Nano Letters, the answer is “surprisingly simple.” It all has to do with little imperfections. “People have tried, but they could not explain experimental results without making assumptions that were not justified or justifiable,” Lawrence Marks, a professor emeritus of materials science and engineering, said on September 18. “We now can… Just having different deformations—and therefore different charges—at the front and back of something sliding leads to current.”\n\nMarks and their colleagues first began exploring static electricity’s properties back in 2019, when they discovered that rubbing two materials against one another bends miniscule variations on each object’s surface. This movement then generated voltages. From there, the team created a new model that relies on the concept known as “elastic shear,” which happens whenever an object resists a sliding force and creates friction in the process. Once the friction builds up on either side of the nanosized deformations, the difference in electrical charges can create a current—and the resultant shock. “We developed a new model that calculates electrical current. The values for the current for a range of different cases were in good agreement with experimental results,” said Marks. Marks notes that while most people associate static electricity with demonstrations such as hair-raising elementary science experiments or touching a doorknob after rubbing your pet’s fur, the electric charge actually exerts a huge influence on the world “in both simple and profound ways.” An everyday example can be seen when a coffee grinder’s charged grains alters the flavor of beans.",

They use a specially-built X-ray telescope to study distant dead stars, collect particles from outer space, and grow crystals that help make new medicines. But they also try experiments that are so simple they could be done with materials you have at home—the only difference is that their home is in microgravity. Microgravity is what makes living aboard the ISS so unique. This phenomenon is often referred to as “zero gravity,” which is actually a misnomer. Gravity is definitely still present and affecting the space station—in fact, it’s the reason the station stays in orbit around Earth! The ISS’s orbit, however, makes it seem like astronauts aren’t subject to gravity while aboard, where they float about in weightlessness and have to use specialized cups to keep the liquid contents from drifting out. This difference in gravity on the ISS affects just about everything you can think of: how the human body works, how liquids move, how plants grow, how food cooks.

The elusive and understudied Bryde’s whale makes an even more mysterious noise called “Biotwang.” This whizzing tone using both low and high frequency pings sounds somewhat electronic or mechanical, unlike more melodic songs made by some baleen whales. Now, this strange vocalization has been recorded and is part of a new repository that can help other scientists study whale vocalizations from eight different species. The findings are described in a study published September 18 in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science. [Related: We finally know how baleen whales make noise.] What is Biotwang? Bryde’s whales–pronounced broodus–are found in the central and western North Pacific. They are less well-known than other baleen whales like humpbacks or right whales. “Bryde’s whales are different from other baleen whales in that we think they may feed year round, migrating between low latitudes and mid latitudes, and following their food all over the ocean,” study co-author and NOAA research oceanographer Ann Allen tells Popular Science. Their more complex patterns of movement around the ocean make them difficult for scientists to find. The team recorded several of these sounds in 2014 using autonomous acoustic recordings taken in the Mariana Archipelago near Guam. Biotwang is produced by Bryde’s whales in the Pacific Ocean. This image of a Byrde’s whale was spotted during a NOAA cetacean survey in the Mariana Archipelago in 2015. The Biotwang was recorded over the Mariana Trench in October 2014 during an Oregon State University Seaglider study.",

These small hippos and dwarf elephants (Palaeoloxodon cypriotes) lived on Cyprus. That is, until paleolithic humans arrived and both species disappeared about 14,000 years ago. Now, an international team of scientists found that the first paleolithic hunter-gatherers may have first driven the hippos and then the elephants to extinction in less than 1,000 years. This new hypothesis refutes some earlier arguments that suggested that a small human population on the island couldn’t have caused these extinctions so quickly. The findings are detailed in a study published September 17 in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B Biological Sciences. [Related: Researchers want to unlock the genetics of the world’s tiniest animals.] Cyprus was home to only these two species of megafauna during the Late Pleistocene. The dwarf elephant was roughly 1,000 pounds, compared to its much larger modern counterparts that can reach up to 12,000 pounds. The dwarf hippo was about 286 pounds, compared to the 9,000 pounds that adult hippos weigh today. Both species disappeared soon after humans arrived roughly 14,000 years ago. Earlier research found that large groups of hundreds to thousands of people may have arrived on Cyprus in two or three main migration events over less than a millennium. The influx of humans had an effect on the megafauna on the island. However, other extinction events have taken place over several thousands of years, so for both species to disappear from the fossil record in such a short amount of time is a paleontological mystery.",

The tool, available in several Watch models starting this week, uses an onboard accelerometer to measure slight wrist movements over time that may be associated with respiratory disturbances while a user is sleeping. The FDA makes clear this feature “is not intended to provide a standalone diagnosis,” or replace a doctor. Still, Apple believes the tool is important, and represents one more way its popular wrist wearable can potentially act “as an intelligent guardian for users’ health.” It’s one of several efforts by Apple to make further inroads into healthcare technology. [ Related: Sleepy and snoring? You may have sleep apnea. ] Millions of people with sleep apnea never receive a diagnosis\n\nSleep apnea is an increasingly common condition where a person temporarily stops breathing while asleep, which can cause blood oxygen levels to drop. This can lead to loud snoring or result in people waking up feeling tired. But that’s just the mild side of the spectrum. When left untreated, sleep apnea has been associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes and has been linked to increased risk for heart disease. Most people never even know they have the condition. The American Medical Association estimates as many as 30 million Americans may experience sleep apnea despite just six million being diagnosed. Worldwide, studies suggest sleep apnea could affect up to one billion people. The popularity and familiarity of the Apple Watch may make it uniquely positioned to serve as a tool to help close that wide diagnosis gap.",

Much of it has stayed up there, orbiting the planet or eventually falling back to Earth and burning up in the atmosphere (or sometimes not). To really send something far out into space, though, you’ve got to put more effort in. Rocket-fueled effort. The spacecraft that’s been launched to explore the outer reaches of the solar system needed a boost to get there, and then further help from the gravity of the planets they passed. Thanks to the general lack of friction in space combined with the abundance of open space, these projectiles can just keep going. The man-made object that is farthest away from Earth and will continue to hold the title is the Voyager 1 spacecraft, followed by Voyager 2. Voyager 1 was launched a couple weeks after Voyager 2, both in 1977. Voyager 1 was so named because it was on a faster trajectory to reach Jupiter and thus would be the first Voyager to see that planet. It is currently more than 15 billion miles away from Earth. Voyager 2 is more than 12 billion miles from home. The probes will celebrate 47 years of operation this year and are NASA’s longest operating spacecraft. Both Voyager probes have flown past Jupiter and Saturn. Voyager 2 has also flown past Uranus and Neptune.

Simple, standardized nuts and bolts. That may not sound too exciting today, but in 1851, the invention allowed engineers to build the Crystal Palace at previously unimaginable speeds. While the Great Exhibition of 1851 showcased Britain’s most advanced and acclaimed industrial capabilities across a number of exhibits, the five-month-long event’s crown jewel undoubtedly came from architect Joseph Paxton. At over 1,827-feet-long, the Crystal Palace was the world’s largest building at the time, and featured a huge glass roof supported by 3,300 cast iron columns. For nearly 175 years, however, a mystery has left historians puzzled—how was it possible for Paxton’s workers to complete construction in only 190 days? A study published in The International Journal for the History of Engineering & Technology now has solved the mystery. According to John Gardner, a professor of English literature at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU), the Crystal Palace relied on a revolutionary screw thread designed by a man named Joseph Whitmore. Before Whitworth’s standardized concept, every screw and bolt was unique to one another without standardized measurements. This meant that lost screws or broken bolts could easily grind construction projects down to a standstill, at least until someone fashioned new replacements. Given its immense size and complexity, the Crystal Palace alone needed 30,000 nuts and bolts—and yet requiring so many pieces somehow didn’t hinder the building’s construction. “The forms of screw threads used in Crystal Palace buildings have not been recorded in any of the surviving drawings,” Gardner and his co-author Ken Kiss wrote in their paper.",

Some Arctic animals like reindeer have several genetic adaptations to help them thrive there, and one of the region’s top predators is no exception. Scientists are piecing together when polar bears (Ursus maritimus) may have evolved some of the genes that separate them from brown bears (Ursus arctos). New genomic analysis reveals that they may have changed as recently as 70,000 years ago. The findings are detailed in a study published September 15 in the journal BMC Genomics. Polar bears are very closely related to brown bears, but have numerous key adaptations that help them survive in extreme arctic conditions. They have two layers of fur to help them keep warm and dry. The first is a large downy layer that’s located right next to their skin. The other layer is made of longer hairs called guard hairs that act like a raincoat. Their fur’s signature bright white hue helps them camouflage. Polar bears can also digest high amounts of cholesterol from blubber without damaging their hearts. This helps them thrive while eating seals and even some whale species like belugas. [Related: Jackrabbit’s color-changing fur may prepare them for climate change.] Scientists believe that the polar bears and brown bears diverged fairly recently in evolutionary terms–within roughly the past one million years. Just how and when polar bears adapted to the Arctic is still debated. In this study, a team analyzed the genomes of 119 modern polar bears, 135 modern brown bears, and two fossilized polar bears. One of the fossils was the Poolepynten jawbone from the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard that dates back between 130,000 and 100,000 years ago.",

According to a study published on September 13 in Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, “presenteeism” doesn’t ensure continual productivity and profit. If anything, it can make workplaces worse off while cumulatively losing billions of dollars in the process. The research was led by Claire Smith, a University of South Florida assistant professor of psychology, who developed a new, 11-attribute assessment called the Presenteeism Pressure Scale. This survey asked respondents to rate on a scale of 1-to-7 various feelings as they related to their jobs. These included prompts such as:\n\nPeople who use sick or mental health days are looked down on in my organization. I am expected to work even if I’m not feeling well. It is uncommon for employees to take sick or mental health days at my organization. Smith then gathered responses from hundreds of participants spread across four groups taking separate surveys. At her project’s conclusion, Smith found that a chronic expectation to work through illnesses is often far more detrimental to an organization than simply allowing people to stay at home and rest. In one study of 764 workers, for example, many said they participated in presenteeism not only due to their own motivations, but because their place of employment made it feel expected of them. Another sample group of over 800 individuals indicated that such pressures caused them to evaluate their organizations negatively—feelings that often led to less job satisfaction and commitment. Yet another group of 350 volunteers took those feelings a step further.",

The Permian-Triassic warming events killed 80 to 90 percent of species living on Earth and offer a stark warning as the planet continues to warm. This new look at how ocean warming played a major role in this volatile time in Earth’s history is detailed in a study published September 12 in the journal Science. The Great Dying\n\nThe Permian-Triassic mass extinction–also called The Great Dying–was triggered by massive volcanic eruptions in present day Siberia. The volcanoes spewed toxic gasses into the atmosphere and the increased carbon dioxide emissions rapidly increased temperatures around the globe. The Great Dying eventually paved the way for dinosaurs to dominate Earth, but it was even worse than the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction that eventually wiped most of them out about 66 million years ago. The increased carbon dioxide from the volcanoes and UV light radiation caused both marine and land ecosystems to break down. However, what caused plants and famously resilient insects on land to suffer as badly as those in the world’s oceans has remained a scientific mystery. [Related: This tiger-sized, saber-toothed, rhino-skinned predator thrived before the ‘Great Dying.’]\n\n“Climate warming alone cannot drive such devastating extinctions because, as we are seeing today, when the tropics become too hot, species migrate to the cooler, higher latitudes,” study co-author Alexander Farnsworth, a meteorologist and climatologist at the University of Bristol in England, said in a statement. “Our research has revealed that increased greenhouse gasses don’t just make the majority of the planet warmer, they also increase weather and climate variability making it even more ‘wild’ and difficult for life to survive.”\n\nAccording to the team, this catastrophe shows that global warming isn’t just a matter of the planet becoming unbearably hot, but also causes conditions to swing wildly over a period of several decades.",

According to one astrophysicist, however, there is a possibility that certain events may increase the chance for a catastrophic rendezvous with the roughly 1,210-foot-wide space rock known as 99942 Apophis. And although the odds remain almost comically small, based on the available evidence, humanity certainly doesn’t want the situation to play out as theorized. Apophis is one of the most studied near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) in history—not for any striking physical characteristics, but for its trajectory. Astronomers initially voiced concern about the possibility of a collision with Earth after discovering it in 2004, and put the odds of such a disaster at 2.7-percent. These calculations originally earned Apophis a Level 4 on the Torino impact hazard scale, the highest ever recorded. Soon, however, revised analysis indicated Apophis’ route was still relatively close to the planet, but safely outside any need for worry. By 2006, its Torino level was lowered to 0, where it has remained ever since. In 2021, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory indicated there was no chance of the asteroid hitting Earth within the next 100 years. But as University of Western Ontario’s Paul Wiegert points out in his new study published in The Planetary Science Journal, these conclusions remain ironclad only so long as nothing influences its path. An encounter with another asteroid, even as small as 2-feet-across, may be enough to alter its route. Increase that object’s size to barely 11-feet, and it could bump Apophis enough to make it a problem for humanity when it reaches its closest proximity to Earth on April 13, 2029.",

The roughly two-hour mission outside their SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, “Resilience,” marked a new phase of private spaceflight. The historic extravehicular activity (EVA) began at approximately 6:12 am ET and lasted almost two hours. Commander Jared Isaacman and mission specialist Sarah Gillis alternated roles exiting the capsule for about 20 minutes each as the spacecraft orbited above Earth. In the process, the pair tested the capabilities and resiliency of SpaceX’s new EVA astronaut suits. “SpaceX, back at home we have a lot of work to do, but from here it looks like a perfect world,” Isaacman radioed back to Earth as he exited the capsule for the first time. Fellow crew mates—mission specialist Anna Menon and retired US Air Force Lt. Col Scott “Kidd” Poteet—remained inside Resilience for the spacewalk’s duration. The Dragon capsule is not designed with an airlock, so both Menon and Poteet also wore EVA suits and were harnessed to their seats in the depressurized cabin.

Also called Latimeria, coelacanths are a deep-sea fish found off eastern Africa and Indonesia today. This new “exceptionally well-preserved” ancient and primitive coelacanth is linked to a period of heightened movement of the Earth’s crust that likely rapidly sped up this fish’s evolution. Ngamugawi wirngarri also helps fill in an important transition between its earliest forms to its more evolved body. The findings are detailed in a study published September 12 in the journal Nature Communications. “Our analyses found that tectonic plate activity had a profound influence on rates of coelacanth evolution,” Alice Clement, a study co-author and evolutionary biologist and palaeontologist from Flinders University in Australia, said in a statement. “Namely that new species of coelacanth were more likely to evolve during periods of heightened tectonic activity as new habitats were divided and created.”\n\n[Related: Our four-legged ancestors evolved from sea to land astonishingly quickly.] What is the Denovian mass extinction?

This formation includes fossils from numerous species that went extinct during the Devonian extinctions, a series of mass extinction events that occurred that primarily affected marine organisms about 359 to 419 million years ago.

According to East Japan Railway (JR East), at least one prototype will debut in 2028. The company revealed its plans on September 10, citing hopes to both streamline its operations and make them more sustainable. Japan’s iconic Shinkansen railines, more commonly known as bullet trains, have been a staple of the nation’s high-speed public transportation routes for over half a century. Traveling as fast as 300 km per hour (roughly 186 mph), the trains weave throughout the country’s major urban areas, and are now completely electric as well as more lightweight than earlier models. According to The Japan Times, self-driving bullet trains have been a part of JR East’s overall plans since at least 2018, when the company presented its “Transformation 2027” project framework. [Related: Texas could get a 205-mph bullet train zipping between Houston and Dallas.] The plan for a phased rollout will begin in 2028 with Shinkansen trains upgraded with second degree automation capabilities. “Second degree,” in this case, means the railcar will operate without a human actively directing its routes, although a driver will remain inside the cockpit in case of any emergencies. These second degree trains will travel within a short section of the route connecting Nagaoka Station and the Niigata station center. JR East will then begin testing third degree automation lines—fully driverless with crew performing other duties as needed elsewhere on the trains—on an out-of-service route the following year. From there, the company hopes to complete a fourth grade automation rollout between Tokyo and Niigata on the Joetsu Shinkansen line by the mid-2030s, with other lines to come.",

Dunn now runs a group called the Public Science Lab, and he’s very into making “new discoveries about daily life, while engaging as many people as possible in the process of discovery.” You may have seen his name in the news before for his work on cataloging and studying the microbes involved in sourdough.

Living microscopic bacteria and fungi are moving more than 1,200 miles between locations, traveling on winds about 10,000 feet above the ground, according to research published September 9 in the journal PNAS. The findings could have implications for human health and the continued spread of drug-resistant genes among pathogens around the globe. An unexpected and unsettling number of these microbes circulating far above the surface are potentially disease-causing and some are resistant to multiple antibiotics, according to the analysis. “We were not supposed to find anything like this,” says lead study author Xavier Rodó, a computational ecologist and research professor at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, where he leads the climate and health group. It’s “detection of an unprecedented diversity of microbial taxa at heights [far above the planetary boundary layer],” he adds. From 10 different sampling flights over Japan, Rodó and his colleagues used genetic analysis to identify 266 fungal and 305 bacterial genera, which he says likely represent upwards of 2,000 total species. Based on their assessment of air currents and other trace compounds found in the samples, the researchers determined these microbes originated in agricultural regions of Northeast Asia and were carried about 1,200 miles through the atmosphere into Japanese airspace, where they slowly floated downward towards Earth’s surface. Many of the microbes detected up high, were also found lower down, implying the bacteria and fungi are making it into our immediate environment. “We were not supposed to find anything like this.”\n\nNot all microbes are harmful, but, notably, more than one third of the collected and ID’d organisms in this case were pathogens known to cause human disease in the correct exposure context.",

A recently published paper in Nature Communications discovered that low-frequency, large-scale circulation changes in the Arctic regulate atmospheric river activity and influence moisture regionwide.\n\nIn recent decades, Arctic surface air temperatures have been warming more than twice the global average rate. With more warming comes more atmospheric moisture. This increased moisture has many effects across the ecosystem, such as higher specific humidity, greater cloud cover and water content and more precipitation across the Arctic.\n\nUsing models and recorded atmospheric river observations, the NSF-funded team discovered the key role of large-scale circulation in regulating moisture transportation toward the poles. These large-scale circulations control atmospheric rivers. Atmospheric rivers are long plumes of intense water vapor that move northeastward, typically formed because of the interaction between a cold front, which contains a large amount of water vapor, and a warm front. These sky streams carry over 90% of outside water vapor into the Arctic. As a result, forces such as circulation that influence these atmospheric rivers influence moisture across the area.",

Several years ago, MIT researchers showed that administering a series of escalating doses of an HIV vaccine over a two-week period could help overcome a part of that challenge by generating larger quantities of neutralizing antibodies. However, a multidose vaccine regimen administered over a short time is not practical for mass vaccination campaigns. In a new study, the researchers have now found that they can achieve a similar immune response with just two doses, given one week apart. The first dose, which is much smaller, prepares the immune system to respond more powerfully to the second, larger dose. This study, which was performed by bringing together computational modeling and experiments in mice, used an HIV envelope protein as the vaccine. A single-dose version of this vaccine is now in clinical trials, and the researchers hope to establish another study group that will receive the vaccine on a two-dose schedule. \"By bringing together the physical and life sciences, we shed light on some basic immunological questions that helped develop this two-dose schedule to mimic the multiple-dose regimen,\" says Arup Chakraborty, the John M.

It's a \"new option for receiving a safe and effective seasonal influenza vaccine potentially with greater convenience, flexibility and accessibility for individuals and families,\" said Dr. Peter Marks, who directs the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. It's been a long time coming, however: MedImmune's FluMist was first approved in 2003 for folks ages 5 to 49 to prevent flu, and then approval was extended to kids ages 2 to 5 in 2007. It's a nasal spritz that contains a weakened form of the live influenza virus. However, it was always administered by a health care provider. Until now. You'll still need a prescription to get FluMist, the FDA said, and only folks aged 18 and older are authorized to administer it to themselves or a child in their care. \"For those interested in self or caregiver administration, the vaccine manufacturer plans to make the vaccine available through a third-party online pharmacy,\" the FDA said. \"Those who choose this option will complete a screening and eligibility assessment when they order FluMist.\" Friday's approval was based on a study \"conducted with vaccine recipients and caregivers to evaluate whether the instructions for use were appropriately designed so that recipients and caregivers could safely and effectively use the vaccine,\" the FDA noted.",

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: Huang, J., et al. Recurrent wheezing is a serious morbidity, and it is estimated that about one-third of school-age children exhibit this symptom in the first five years of life. Recurrent wheezing in childhood is a significant risk factor for irreversible lung damage in adulthood. Therefore, it is crucial to accurately identify children with this condition at an early age and to enhance the efficacy of treatment and prevention strategies. However, the capacity to diagnose these cases in the preschool period remains constrained. In a study published in the journal Wearable Electronics, a group of researchers from China outlined their development of a sensor for continuous and stable monitoring of respiration. Notably, the sensor is isolated from the effects of temperature and humidity of the respiratory airflow and is able to accurately discriminate between wheezing and normal respiration. \"Breath-carrying temperature and humidity co-exist and interfere with each other, so detecting breath temperature or humidity to characterize breath inevitably reduces accuracy and stability,\" explains the study's senior and co-corresponding author, Yuanjie Su, a professor at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. \"Typical respiratory sensors are enabled by assessing the expansion and contraction of the abdomen and chest during breathing, and they are immune to humidity and temperature. However, body movements such as limb movements or coughing can easily create crosstalk signals that can affect the accuracy of the readings.\" The team discovered that the integration of highly conductive, low-density carbon nanotubes into electrospun polyacrylonitrile scaffolds facilitated the detection of exhaled gas streams.",

It “opens up a complete new avenue [to rescue] this magnificent species and icon of conservation,” and may suggest strategies for generating stem cells for other vulnerable and endangered species. Researchers have already turned both mice and human skin cells, called fibroblasts, into stem cells, specifically pluripotent stem cells (SN: 12/24/14). These stem cells “have unlimited proliferation potential and can form any kind of cell, tissue or organ in the body under certain conditions,” says Liu Jing, a stem cell researcher at Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The catch with creating them is that the process must be tailored to each new species. To reprogram pandas’ fibroblasts into pluripotent stem cells, the team first put some genes known to reprogram adult cells into the skin cells along with small RNA molecules known to enhance the transition to stem cells. The researchers also had to identify the specific proteins and growth factors that would help turn the panda skin cells to stem cells, as well as ones that would keep them in the pluripotent state. Having pluripotent cells essentially on demand could allow scientists to create giant panda primordial germ cells, precursors to sperm and egg cells, a feat that’s been done in mice and northern white rhinos (SN: 10/17/16). Obtaining these panda sex cells has been difficult because the majority of the living panda population remains under strict protections that forbid typical egg extraction techniques, such as giving pandas medicine to make extra eggs in a cycle or retrieving eggs from ovaries.",

They are the only known type of fundamental subatomic particle for which this basic property is unknown, and some researchers suspect that this missing knowledge could be a gateway to a new understanding of physics. “Neutrinos are one of the key particles that we do not understand as well as we do others, but that have nevertheless profound cosmological consequences,” says particle cosmologist Miguel Escudero of the European particle physics lab CERN near Geneva. The little particles’ outsize role in sculpting the universe means they bridge the gap between the subatomic world, usually studied at particle accelerators or physics labs, and the cosmological one discerned by peering out at the heavens. So scientists are using both observations of space and experiments on the ground in an attempt to solve this massive mystery. But if you ask a cosmologist how much neutrinos weigh and ask a particle physicist the same question, you might get two different answers. The two groups’ methods of gauging those masses are showing signs of a disconnect. Recent cosmological data collected by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, or DESI, favors masses that are unexpectedly small and creeping close to conflict with those of particle physics experiments. In fact, some interpretations of the DESI data suggest that neutrinos have no mass or even negative mass, normally a forbidden concept in physics (SN: 11/21/14). The odd result has physicists considering some tantalizing ideas — that neutrinos’ masses might change over the history of the universe, or that the apparent negative masses are an illusion caused by dark energy, the mysterious phenomenon causing the universe to expand at an accelerating rate.",

        "text": "After Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, and during Israel’s ongoing military response in Gaza, activists organized anti-Israel protests on dozens of college campuses. Amid rallies, encampments on quads, and occupations of campus buildings, anti-Semitism surged. Some groups expressed solidarity with Hamas. Some individuals tore down posters urging the safe return of hostages. Some student activists harassed, intimidated, and vilified their Jewish peers, or attempted to restrict the movements of suspected Zionists. In response, several institutions, including Stanford, Harvard, Columbia, and the University of Pennsylvania, created task forces to study anti-Semitism on their campuses. Now those task forces have begun to release reports with findings and recommendations. Stanford found anti-Semitism to be “widespread.” Harvard reported that Jews and Israelis faced “shunning, harassment, and intimidation.” Columbia found that they “have been the object of racist epithets and graffiti, anti-Semitic tropes, and confrontational and unwelcome questions.” All of the task forces explored how to protect Jews from discrimination, harassment, and barriers to educational access, while also honoring commitments to free speech. Most schools urged expanding diversity, equity, and inclusion frameworks to encompass and benefit Jews. Theo Baker: The war at Stanford\n\nBut Stanford rejected that approach, arguing that DEI is itself “fundamentally flawed.” Instead, its task force recommended treating all students equally and helping them to forge a culture that encourages constructive disagreement. Alone among the reports, the Stanford recommendations offer its campus and other institutions that heed its advice a path to a better future. DEI ideology, programs, and bureaucracies have powerfully shaped campus life over the past decade.",

En route, I sometimes think how nice it would be to stop for a beer, skip the rites, and arrive in time for what moves me most: the vows. Of course, I never indulge that impulse. I get there on time and sit, bored, because I am there to support my friends, not to be maximally entertained. But would I make it to the church on time if, on my ride there, a devil on my shoulder tempted me with particular diversions? “Forget the ceremony: Bruce Springsteen is drinking at that brewery!” the imp might whisper. “Look, that elderly man is dazzling teens with playground dunks! Wow, 22-year-olds in bikinis are washing Ferraris outside that mansion! Whoosh, skateboarders are bombing down that hill!”\n\nIn my digital life, Instagram is that devil. When the app launched in 2010, my friends and I loved how easy it was to share images that conveyed bits of our lives to one another. It helped us stay in better touch across time and distance than we might have otherwise. It hardly mattered that some of the photos we posted were, well, boring. But lately, I am starting to hate Instagram. Because my loved ones are still on the platform, I still post there and peruse my feed, but I resent that it actively obstructs my efforts to prioritize them and their posts.

They say that because of their ethnicity, ancestry, and national origin, their professor subjected them to unequal treatment, trying to suppress their speech in class and allowing teaching assistants and classmates to create a hostile climate for Jews. Afterward, they filed a complaint with Harvard alleging a violation of their civil rights. In May, their allegations appeared in a federal civil-rights lawsuit. It cites their claims as evidence that Harvard “ignores and tolerates” anti-Semitism. Their professor, who is also Jewish, rejects that narrative and maintains that he taught the class appropriately. What do colleges owe their Jewish students? Administrators, faculty, and members of Congress have debated that polarizing question in recent months. Soon, judges and juries may impose some answers. At least 19 lawsuits pending against institutions of higher education allege anti-Semitism that violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which mandates that no person shall, on grounds of race or national origin, “be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under” a program that receives federal funds. Dara Horn: Why the most educated people in America fall for anti-Semitic lies\n\nIf you had to choose just one of these cases to illustrate their fraught implications, you couldn’t do better than the dispute at Harvard. The students make a strong case that they were subject to discrimination, strong enough that an outside attorney hired by Harvard to investigate agreed. At a minimum, I think they were treated unfairly.

In 1984, George Orwell coined the term thoughtcrime. In the short story “The Minority Report,” the science-fiction author Philip K. Dick gave us the concept of “precrime,” describing a society where would-be criminals were arrested before they could act. Now Canada is combining the concepts in a work of dystopian nonfiction: A bill making its way through Parliament would impose draconian criminal penalties on hate speech and curtail people’s liberty in order to stop future crimes they haven’t yet committed. The Online Harms Act states that any person who advocates for or promotes genocide is “liable to imprisonment for life.” It defines lesser “hate crimes” as including online speech that is “likely to foment detestation or vilification” on the basis of race, religion, gender, or other protected categories. And if someone “fears” they may become a victim of a hate crime, they can go before a judge, who may summon the preemptively accused for a sort of precrime trial. If the judge finds “reasonable grounds” for the fear, the defendant must enter into “a recognizance.”\n\nA recognizance is no mere promise to refrain from committing hate crimes. The judge may put the defendant under house arrest or electronic surveillance and order them to abstain from alcohol and drugs. Refusal to “enter the recognizance” for one year results in 12 months in prison. This is madness.",

On Sunday at Duke University, the comedian Jerry Seinfeld delivered a commencement address that was, bizarrely, overshadowed in the media by a tiny, nondisruptive protest. Seinfeld gave a compliment and a warning to his Gen Z audience. First came the compliment. “I totally admire the ambitions of your generation to create a more just and inclusive society,” he said. “I think it is also wonderful that you care so much about not hurting other people’s feelings in the million and one ways we all do that.”\n\nThen came the warning. “What I need to tell you as a comedian: Do not lose your sense of humor. You can have no idea at this point in your life how much you are going to need it to get through. Not enough of life makes sense for you to be able to survive it without humor.”\n\nSeinfeld went on to defend “the slightly uncomfortable feeling of awkward humor,” arguing that it is “not something you need to fix,” because even as Gen Z improves the world, it will remain “a pretty insane mess.” Humor, he said, is “the most survival-essential quality you will ever have or need to navigate through the human experience.”\n\nTyler Austin Harper: America’s colleges are reaping what they sowed\n\nAll of that is newsworthy.

        "text": "Updated at 10:58 a.m. ET on April 27, 2024. At Columbia University, administrators and pro-Palestinian students occupying the main quad on campus are in a standoff. President Minouche Shafik has satisfied neither those clamoring for order nor those who want untrammeled protests. Yet a different leader may not have performed any better. The tensions here between free-speech values and antidiscrimination law are unusually complex and difficult, if not impossible, to resolve. Shafik presides over a lavishly funded center of research, teaching, civic acculturation, and student activism. Such institutions cannot thrive without strong free-speech cultures. Neither can they thrive without limits on when and where protests are permitted—especially when protesters disrupt the institution as a tactic to get what they want. As Shafik told Congress in recent testimony, “Trying to reconcile the free-speech rights of those who want to protest and the rights of Jewish students to be in an environment free of harassment or discrimination has been the central challenge on our campus, and many others, in recent months.”\n\nThat is a formidable challenge. The best protest rules are viewpoint-neutral: They constrain equally, rather than coercively disadvantaging one side in a controversy. How strictly should they be enforced? Whatever the answer, it must apply equally to all students. Yet consistent support for viewpoint neutrality is rare inside and outside academia, especially on an issue as fraught as Israel-Palestine, which has divided Columbia’s faculty and students for decades. All of that context informed a flash point that occurred at Columbia last week: As Palestine-aligned protesters occupied the quad, where many activists covered their face to obscure their identity, Shafik declared, “I have determined that the encampment and related disruptions pose a clear and present danger to the substantial functioning of the University.” After repeatedly warning students to leave and suspending them when they refused, she called the NYPD to remove them from campus, citing vague safety concerns.",

Roughly a decade after the movement for diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI, began to spread in American higher education, a political backlash is here. The Chronicle of Higher Education has tallied 80 bills since 2023 that aim to restrict DEI in some way, by banning DEI offices, mandatory diversity training, faculty diversity statements, and more. Eight have already become law, including in Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Tennessee, North Dakota, and Utah. The worst of these laws violate academic independence and free speech by attempting to forbid certain ideas in the classroom. Utah’s Equal Opportunities Initiatives, or H.B. 261, which was signed into law in January, is more promising. It attempts to end the excessive and at times coercive focus on identity in higher education while also trying to protect academic freedom with carve-outs for research and course teaching. The law prohibits universities from giving individuals preferential treatment or discriminating against them based on race, color, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, or gender identity. It forbids offices that help students from excluding anyone based on their identity. It bans mandatory campus training sessions that promote differential treatment. It prohibits “discriminatory practices,” such as ascribing “values, morals, or ethical codes, privileges, or beliefs to an individual” because of their identity. Conor Friedersdorf: The DEI industry needs to check its privilege\n\nYet it makes real compromises with DEI supporters.

And if he wins the GOP nomination, he has a very good shot at winning the presidency. So it’s worth entertaining the strongest argument against Trump, which many Americans haven’t heard before: that Trump brings out the worst in many of us—his critics and supporters alike. To really make this anti-Trump argument, one must go so far as to acknowledge that the anti-Trump coalition has sometimes engaged in unreason, hysteria, and abuses of power. The name for this phenomenon is Trump Derangement Syndrome. In 2003, the conservative writer Charles Krauthammer coined the term Bush Derangement Syndrome to describe “the acute onset of paranoia in otherwise normal people in reaction to the policies, the presidency––nay––the very existence of George W. Bush.” The idea wasn’t that any opposition to Bush or his policies was deranged, but rather that Bush hatred was causing some of the president’s critics to indulge in preposterous claims, such as asserting that he’d known the 9/11 attacks were coming. Trump Derangement Syndrome is similar but more intense and widespread. I’m 44. I remember extreme hatred of numerous politicians, including Bill Clinton, Bush, and Barack Obama. But nothing comes close to the reaction to Trump’s presidency. Many Americans hold as an article of faith that Trump is a tool of Russia and a fascistic danger to democracy who ought to be thrown off the ballot in all 50 states and imprisoned for life.",

Updated at 1 p.m. ET on January 30, 2024. Zack De Piero taught writing for four years in the English department at Penn State’s Abington campus. Then he resigned and, in 2023, filed a lawsuit alleging that administrators and other faculty members discriminated against him because he is white. In his telling, the school’s diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by creating a hostile work environment. In response, hundreds of academics signed an open letter calling the lawsuit a reactionary attack on “ongoing efforts in diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging.”\n\nThe dispute, like so many in higher education, pits a faction that believes that the prevailing campus attitudes toward identity are racist against a faction that believes that they help fight racism. It is hardly unique in raising the question of whether DEI initiatives ever go too far. Still, this case stands out, not only because it resulted in a federal lawsuit, but because earlier this month, a judge denied Penn State’s motion to dismiss De Piero’s hostile-workplace claim. The case can now move forward. The ruling comes as backlash against DEI initiatives is growing and questions about when they violate antidiscrimination law remain unsettled. More significant, it establishes a standard that federal judges of varying ideologies could plausibly adopt, and that other plaintiffs can use to bring bias claims to trial. This isn’t a case where, say, a white Donald Trump appointee who hates academia took an extreme position, like “Any departure from color-blindness is illegal,” that would be overturned on appeal.",

Lots of porn is produced by people who want to be doing it and are paid well for it. I barely scrape by working my ass off in retail. How am I less exploited than a woman who reveals what nature gave her and profits from it? I have a long-term partner and we include porn in our sex life.

Though it supported the deal, the doctors’ union – the British Medical Association (BMA) – says it still leaves junior doctors worse off than they were in 2009. FactCheck takes a look at the figures. How much will junior doctors get? The deal is equivalent to a 22 per cent pay rise over two years. Junior doctors will receive a rise of 13 per cent for the year ending March 2024, and a further 8 per cent for the year ending March 2025. Does this leave doctors worse off than in 2009? The British Medical Association said the pay offer “does not amount to full pay restoration”. By this, it means that junior doctors’ pay is still lower than it was in 2009, once we account for inflation. It calculates that junior doctors’ pay was 30 per cent lower in 2023 than in 2009 in “real terms” (i.e. after inflation). And it says the new deal would only partly reverse this loss – meaning by 2025, junior doctors’ pay would still be 20 per cent lower than in 2009. But FactCheck calculates that junior doctors’ pay actually fell in real terms by around 20 per cent, not 30 per cent as the BMA claims. And we estimate that the new pay deal would reduce this loss to around 3 per cent by 2025. That means that the planned pay rise would actually bring junior doctors very close to pay restoration – up to about 97 percent of their 2009 real-terms pay.",

So, is this allowed and have any parliamentary rules been broken? FactCheck takes a look. What did Lord Alli donate to the Starmers? Labour donor and former chairman of online fashion retailer Asos, Lord Alli, covered the cost of a personal shopper, clothes and alterations for Victoria Starmer – both before and after Labour’s election win on 4 July – according to The Sunday Times. (The peer reportedly also gave the prime minister nearly £19,000 worth of work clothes, £20,000 of accommodation and provided a similar sum for “private office” costs – though these are not directly implicated in this row as they were all disclosed at the time, according to the paper.) Have parliamentary rules been broken? Like all MPs, the prime minister has to register all financial interests within 28 days of a new parliament beginning. This also includes donations to family members. But according to The Sunday Times, the prime minister’s office reportedly approached parliamentary authorities just last week in order to make a late declaration. The Conservative Party has called for “a full investigation” after “apparent serious breaches of parliamentary rules”. Downing Street has accepted that Sir Keir did initially fail to declare the donations. A spokeswoman for No 10 said: “We sought advice from the authorities on coming to office. “We believed we had been compliant, however, following further interrogation this month, we have declared further items.”\n\nAnd speaking to broadcasters yesterday, the prime minister said “it’s very important to me that the rules are followed,” before adding: “and that’s why, shortly after the election, my team reached out for advice on what declaration should be made so it’s in accordance with the rules”.",

What is the private school claim? It’s the last school term before one of the new government’s most debated pledges kicks in – VAT on private school fees will be charged across the UK from January. Many independent schools argue it will lead to an exodus of pupils from private settings, overloading an already-saturated state sector. Would state schools have room? FactCheck found most parts of the UK had plenty of capacity in state schools. A study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, cited by the government, suggests private schools could lose between 4 per cent and 7 per cent of pupils in the coming years because of the addition of VAT to fees. At secondary level, when any pressure would be most keenly felt, our exclusive analysis of Department for Education data found that 144 of 152 council areas in England would have enough available places to accommodate 7 per cent of local private school pupils in the 2025/26 school year. Eight would not have this level of spare places: Coventry, Manchester, Stoke-on-Trent, Telford & Wrekin, Rutland, Kingston Upon Thames, Salford and Richmond Upon Thames. The independent sector has argued that private schools could lose far more pupils – perhaps even as high as 25 per cent – in the coming years. FactCheck analysis showed that 136 council areas would still be able to accommodate 25 per cent of local private secondary pupils. 16 did not have that level of spare places.",

FactCheck takes a look. What changes are being made to Ofsted inspection grades? The overall grade categories of ‘Outstanding’, ‘Good’, ‘Requires Improvement’ and ‘Inadequate’ will no longer be issued to schools with immediate effect. The headline grades – also known as single word judgements – have been used to summarise the overall performance of schools. But these are now being scrapped. So from today until September 2025, schools that are inspected will instead receive a rating in the four existing subcategories: quality of education, behaviour and attitudes, personal development, and leadership and management. As Ofsted inspection reports already contain these subcategories, parents will still be able to compare schools by looking at how they perform in each of these areas. But they won’t have a single word judgement covering the school as a whole to consider. Schools that already have an existing grade in place will keep this until they are next inspected. From September 2025, “School Report Cards” will be introduced, which the Department for Education says “will provide parents with a full and comprehensive assessment of how schools are performing”. Education secretary Bridget Phillipson, said: “Single headline grades are low information for parents and high stakes for schools. Parents deserve a much clearer, much broader picture of how schools are performing – that’s what our report cards will provide.”\n\nHow have parent groups and teachers reacted?",

FactCheck takes a look. How much will energy prices rise by? Ofgem said a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity would pay £1,717 a year from October – when the new price cap comes into place. This will be a £149 a year rise compared with a current typical annual bill of £1,568. The price cap – updated every quarter – sets the maximum amount suppliers can charge per unit of gas and electricity, with standing charges taken into account. It is not a cap on customers’ overall energy bills, which will still rise or fall in line with their energy consumption. Those living in larger properties tend to pay more overall due to higher energy usage, with those in smaller properties usually paying less. How much have prices risen since 2019? The price cap was first introduced by Ofgem on 1 January 2019 to make sure that energy bills accurately reflected the cost of energy. The below graph from Ofgem shows how the average annual cost has changed since then. Prices were relatively stable at around £1,000 until they began to rise in summer 2022 to around £1,900, reflecting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine earlier that year. Prices reached a peak of £4,000 a year by March 2023. By the following winter, they’d fallen again – and have mostly declined since the start of this year. But as of October, the average household will still pay £628 more than they did in the winter of 2019/20.",

This is the first case of this variant to be diagnosed outside the African continent, although it was contracted during a stay in Africa, according to the Swedish authorities. The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the outbreak of the Clade 1 strain a public health emergency of “international concern” on 14 August. So, what is the infection, what are the symptoms and is there a vaccine? Let’s take a look. What is mpox? Mpox – previously known as monkeypox – is a rare infection that is most commonly found in west or central Africa. Anyone can get mpox and it can be passed on from person to person through close physical contact with blisters or scabs, touching the clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with mpox, and the coughs or sneezes of a person with the infection when they’re close to you. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is in the middle of an outbreak of Clade 1, with confirmed cases reaching countries across Africa. In the DRC, there’s been more than 15,600 cases of mpox so far this year, and 537 deaths. In 2022, there was an outbreak of the Clade 2 mpox variant, which was first detected in London. It resulted in 87,000 cases across 110 countries and 112 deaths. Are there any UK cases of Clade 1 mpox? So far in the UK, there have been no recorded cases of the Clade 1 variant during the current outbreak.",

We’re talking about officers with at least five years of service under their belt. And the picture looks even worse if you consider officers with at least ten years of service – there are half as many of these compared to 2010. Our findings come as the government announces an extra £100m for HMP Wandsworth, after it received a “catastrophic inspection” from the chief inspector of prisons, Charlie Taylor. Wandsworth inspection report\n\nThe inspection report into Wandsworth found “chaos” in the prison, and attributed some of the problems to staff inexperience. Three quarters of prisoners reported spending at least 22 hours per day locked in their cells. And the report said that “inexperience across every grade of operational staff” was preventing them from “bringing about much needed change” and sustaining progress.

So what has happened to prison staffing over the past decade or so?

Regulator under fire\n\nThe Care Quality Commission (CQC) regulates all aspects of the health and social care sector in England, from GPs to care homes. It has faced criticism in recent days as an independent review found “significant failings” in its effectiveness. An interim report by the review said that the watchdog had failed to provide a rating for an estimated one in five of all the locations under its purview. Our findings: NHS acute hospitals\n\nOur exclusive FactCheck analysis of the CQC’s own data looks at one part of the regulator’s remit: NHS acute hospitals. That’s where patients “receive active, short-term treatment for a condition”, according to the Health Foundation think tank. So that’s things like A&E and maternity units, but not GP or community-based services. Our analysis finds that a third of NHS acute hospitals have never been inspected while being run by their current provider – that means the organisation which runs the hospital. This is usually an NHS Trust. Our figure could include hospitals that were inspected when a different provider was in charge, though we understand any such cases can only represent a small fraction of the total. Of those NHS hospitals that have been inspected under their current provider, we’ve found that over 40 per cent haven’t been inspected for five years or more – and 13 per cent haven’t been inspected for over a decade.",

As of early Friday, Trump’s shares are estimated to be worth around $1.6 billion. The media company stock was originally overvalued at close to $9 billion.

The late-Thursday night federal filing references sealed eyewitness statements that describe a high school junior attending a party in a home laden with drugs, where Gaetz and other adults came together for sex. As NOTUS reports, Gaetz has consistently claimed he was not at the July 2017 party, but testimony from his own ex-girlfriend rebuts that claim. The witnesses cite the presence of “alcohol, cocaine, ecstasy … and marijuana” and confirm that those present were there to “engage in sexual activities.” They also confirm the presence of a 17-year-old girl who was “naked” at the party. The event took place at the home of lobbyist Chris Dorworth, a friend of Gaetz. Cell phone records show that Gaetz and Dorworth communicated “constantly” during the day before the party—including some 30 text messages. RELATED STORY: '2 guys, 4 girls': New text messages revealed in Matt Gaetz ethics probe\n\nGaetz remains under investigation by the House Ethics Committee. The scandal began heating up again earlier this month after Dorworth dropped a 2023 defamation suit against Gaetz’s former associate Joel Greenberg.

The slogan, “Kamala Harris for the People,” only underscores this commitment. “Our nation has a precious, fleeting opportunity in this election to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past,” she said at the conclusion of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, on Aug. 22. “I know there are people with varying political views watching tonight, and I promise to be a president for all Americans.”\n\nShe later released an ad highlighting her history as a California prosecutor, emphasizing that her role did not dictate whom she would fight for. Similarly, she asserts that party affiliation won’t influence her as president. On Friday, the campaign proved how they are walking the walk, not just talking the talk.

As chants rang out among nearly 60 pro-Palestinian campus protesters, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill trustee stood less than 30 feet away, recording video on his phone as the group surrounded the Old Well—a beautified outdoor drinking fountain recognizable as the school’s logo. “Oh, that’s great,” he remarked, before ironically joining in the cries. For nearly the entire afternoon of Saturday, May 11—commencement day for UNC’s class of 2024—Kotis had observed protesters led by the school’s then-newly suspended Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) chapter as they slowly crossed UNC-Chapel Hill’s campus, rallying at different landmarks. Outside the South Building, UNC’s main administrative office, the group spilled red paint down the front entrance steps, using the leftover color to cover the facade in faux bloody handprints as others scribbled slogans. Kotis kept his distance, monitoring—alongside university police—the demonstrators to ensure their vandalism was nothing maintenance crews would not be able to clean up quickly. Trying to avoid an inopportune run-in, he attempted to go unrecognized. However, as the marchers rallied at the Old Well in the early evening, an organizer spotted Kotis. The chants aimed at him soon broke out. “I thought it was funny,” he told The Dispatch in a phone interview. Kotis is used to the attention.

Recently, a social media post claiming that reducing interest rates would do more than a subsidy to lower mortgage payments has gone viral across several platforms. “A $325k home with a $25k tax credit bringing the cost to $300k with a 7% interest rate is $1991 a month,” Facebook user Jason Dean Longo posted. “A $325k home at 3.25% is $1414 a month. That’s a $577 a month difference and over 30 years a savings of $207,720.”\n\nTexas real estate agent Ashley Taylor Cooper reshared Longo’s post, and her post has been shared more than 29,000 times on Facebook and made its way to X. The post’s theoretical example gets the math right in terms of how monthly payments are calculated. However, according to Federal Reserve Economic Data, the 30-year fixed rate mortgage average in the United States is 6.2 percent and was at 6.99 percent as recently as June 6. Monthly mortgage payments can be calculated with the following formula, where r is the monthly interest rate and n is the number of months of payment. Although the interest rate figures used in the example are likely annual rates—not monthly rates that banks tend to use—that figure can be easily converted by dividing by the number of months in a year, 12. Therefore, the respective interest rates of 7 percent and 3.25 percent cited in the viral post convert to monthly interest rates of 0.58333 and 0.27803, respectively.",

In 2022, mpox — a disease caused by the monkeypox virus, which is found in small mammals and has been known to infect people in parts of Africa for decades — burst into greater international awareness. The virus, which causes a painful rash and can be deadly, spread around the world, primarily among men who have sex with men. In response, the World Health Organization and the U.S. government declared public health emergencies. Mpox cases outside Africa subsequently decreased, and the public health emergencies were declared over in 2023. The global outbreak is still ongoing, but case numbers have fallen significantly. In the U.S., for example, the number of people diagnosed with mpox is down from a high of 11,000 cases per month in the summer of 2022 to 250 cases per month now, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, the situation in Africa in recent years has noticeably worsened. On Aug. 14, the WHO once again declared an mpox public health emergency of international concern. A day earlier, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention had declared a public health emergency of continental security. Especially in the Democratic Republic of Congo, mpox cases are surging — this time primarily from two other types of the virus. As of late August, there have been more than 20,000 mpox cases and more than 600 deaths reported in Africa in 2024, although not all are confirmed cases, given a dearth of access to testing. This compares with around 15,000 reported cases in 2023. One type of the virus has now spread to countries in Africa where mpox has not been historically reported.",

Signs have been mounting that, for the first time in recent decades, Democrats may lose majority support from young men in 2024. The risk to Democrats is that this is not just a one-time fluke but an indication of growing trouble with men in coming elections. Democrats can celebrate the support they are getting from young women, but they also need to take the disaffection of young men seriously, engage them directly, and respond to the visions of manhood and masculinity that Donald Trump and J.D. Vance are offering. Although men overall have moved toward the Republicans over the past half-century, the youth vote has given Democrats grounds for hope that the losses among men have been transitional, a reflection of an older generation’s difficulties in adjusting to more equal gender relations and a changed economy. Young men’s support for Democrats reached a high point in Barack Obama’s victories. According to exit polls in 2008 , Obama won 62 percent of 18-to-29-year-old men as well as 69 percent of women that age.

North Carolina had moved young offenders in a productive direction. Under the state’s 2019 Raise the Age (RTA) reforms, juvenile offenders had a chance to avoid marring their lives with convictions that would hinder their employment opportunities, compromise their eligibility for government services, and set back their social lives. Juvenile offender records are permanently sealed, unlike publicly accessible adult conviction records. Based on provisions in 46 other states, cases involving young people 18 years old and under were heard in the juvenile system and 16- and 17-year-olds were not charged in the adult courts for misdemeanors or certain felonies. Youths charged with more serious crimes like armed robbery would have their cases heard in a juvenile court first before a possible transfer to the adult system. The reason for keeping young people out of the adult courts is this: The juvenile justice system allows young offenders to “age out” of extreme behaviors in a controlled and supportive environment. That window closes when teens face assaults, solitary confinement, and other types of physical and emotional abuse that are prevalent in adult facilities. There are physiological reasons as well: The adult brain does not reach full maturity until around age 25—which explains why teenagers gravitate toward sensation-seeking behaviors like theft. With the legislature committed to penalizing young people, Winston-Salem social services organizations have been moving in a different direction. William Lassiter, North Carolina’s deputy secretary of the Division of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (JJPD) had helped craft the RTA reforms to reduce juvenile recidivism rates and provide a cost-effective alternative catering to the unique developmental needs of teenagers.",

The accounts vary, but the essential threads are these: On Sunday, New York police officers saw a man evade his subway fare and try to board a train at a Brooklyn station. They used a taser on the man; it did not slow him down. The man flashed a knife. The officers shot and wounded four people: the alleged fare evader, one officer, and two bystanders, a middle-aged man and a young woman. For policing specialists with NYPD experience, the incident raised questions about the force’s use of lethal force and its de-escalation tactics. The alleged assailant may face charges of attempted assault and fare evasion. One of the victims, Gregory Delpeche, remains in critical condition and his family has called for an investigation of the police response.

The Senate voted on this same bill in June, and all but two Republicans (including vice-presidential candidate J.D.

Burritt speaks before President Donald Trump at the U.S. Steel Granite City Works plant, July 26, 2018, in Granite City, Illinois. Between now and Election Day, as every pollster has attested, Pennsylvania is the center of the political universe. All things Pennsylvanian loom larger than they otherwise would, as their effect on the presidential race could end up either enhancing or dismembering American democracy. One of those Pennsylvania issues that has been looming large for months has been the projected sale of U.S. Steel (USS)—once the largest, and still one of the most iconic, Pennsylvania-based companies—to Japan’s Nippon Steel. Both Democratic and Republican elected officials have opposed that sale, for a disparate range of reasons. To Trump and the MAGAnauts, the very names of the two companies suggested that America would be submitting to a foreign power if the Nippon sale went through. To union-friendly Democrats, the rejection of a previous bid from Cleveland-Cliffs—an American steelmaker that has good relations with its unions and makes a decent profit to boot—was emblematic of U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt’s unabashed union-loathing, making his effort to unload the company to Nippon a deliberate affront to USS’s employees. More from Harold Meyerson\n\nThough the Steelworkers’ contract with USS required the company to inform the union of ongoing negotiations with possible buyers, USS kept its dealings with Nippon secret until it announced its desire to accept Nippon’s offer. Once it made that offer public, the union announced its opposition, as Nippon has no history of support for U.S. organized labor, and offered no guarantees, once the Steelworkers contract expired in 2026, that it would not shift production to USS’s non-union plant in Arkansas or even to Japan.",

Donald Trump, as he is virtually all the time, was incoherent, spewed blatant lies, and otherwise sounded totally incomprehensible. Kamala Harris, on the other hand, did an excellent job letting Trump hang himself on his own rope. Her ability to articulate the policy of her potential administration was more mixed. On economics, the campaign still has some work to do in articulating a coherent vision for working Americans. But on abortion and reproductive rights, where Harris has been the administration’s most prominent voice for years, she convincingly made the case for how the administration shares the anger of voters having their rights stripped from them and will fight to protect the right to an abortion, presenting a stark contrast to Trump’s unintelligible rants. The most worrying moment of the debate was Trump repeating J.D. Vance’s outrageous lies about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, eating household pets, It’s a problem that racist conspiracy theories circulated by dark corners of the internet can be eagerly spread through Donald Trump’s enormous platform, targeting groups of people and encouraging racist violence. In any case, this will be a very close election, if the flood of direct mail from outside pro-Trump groups targeting swing-state voters (like Ryan!) is any indication. Polls show a very close race, and the far right has made worrying gains among male voters. Is the Harris campaign ready for this challenge?",

Since 2021, the Biden administration has tried to revive the SBA’s founding mission under Guzman. It’s commonplace during an election year to hear politicians (or even actors playing politicians in movies ) trot out some version of the line “Small businesses are the backbone of our economy,” and court their support. This year, both presidential candidates have rhetorically made small-business entrepreneurs a centerpiece of their campaigns, and that’s mostly taken the form of plans to slash taxes for them. The Harris campaign recently unveiled a proposal to expand a tax deduction for startup businesses from $5,000 to $50,000, in contrast to her overall pledge to raise taxes on wealthy individuals and corporations. She mentioned this small-business plan in the opening answer she gave at the presidential debate in Philadelphia on Tuesday. But actual independent business owners are not clamoring for lower taxes, at least not compared to higher priorities like accessing credit, according to their own survey responses. More from Luke Goldstein\n\nThis contrast was put in stark relief in Washington yesterday at a fireside chat between Federal Trade Commission chair Lina Khan and Small Business Administration head Isabel Casillas Guzman. These are two of the regulators in the federal government who deal most closely with small-business groups, hearing their concerns and aspirations. The issue of taxation did not come up once during the chat or during the question-and-answer period from business owners in attendance, many of whom were in town from across the country for the SBA’s Regional Regulatory Fairness Board meeting this week.",

During a break, Adrian Davis, a self-described “political nerd” and union member of five years, asked a fellow carpenter for his thoughts on Kamala Harris.

Just north of town, Carpenters union members were expanding U.S. Highway 395. Out east, in the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center, they were building a massive battery recycling plant. And just weeks before, the Biden-Harris administration had selected the area as one of 12 regional tech hubs to receive a second round of funding from the federal government, along with hubs in Wisconsin, New York, Georgia and Florida.

The Times found Harris winning Pennsylvania by 4 points, just outside the margin of error, but deadlocked with Donald Trump nationwide. While Harris beats Trump by 13 points on who best will handle abortion, Trump beats Harris by 13 points on the economy, 12 points on the border, and 8 points on Ukraine. Among independents, Trump leads by 4 points. Asked if Harris represents change or more of the same, 52 percent of voters said more of the same. By contrast, 59 percent said Trump represents change. He's the disrupter in a year when, according to RealClearPolitics, 61 percent of voters say the country is on the wrong track. Harris shoulders a burden: Joe Biden. The president's job approval remains low at 42 percent. His personal favorability, also 42 percent, lags behind both Trump's (45 percent) and Harris's (49 percent). This makes Harris's job more difficult. Running for the White House as a sitting vice president is hard enough. Yet the two most recent vice presidents who did it benefited from having bosses who were more popular than they were. That is a luxury Harris does not enjoy. The nonjudicial legacies of previous one-termers, from Carter to Bush to (perhaps) Trump, have been mixed but relatively short-lived. Carter's foreign and economic policies were a mess until a late-term correction. Bush was a foreign policy champ whose domestic policies satisfied few. Biden is unusual. He's a declared one-termer whose consequences, both foreign and domestic, will be long-lasting and negative.",

Now, we're told that she's a cultural phenomenon. The next Obama. She's \"brat\"—whatever that means. Harris's new status isn't due to her policy proposals. She hardly has any. Her public speeches are fine, but she's no Cicero. Oratory isn't her strength. Nor has she become more popular because she's often in the public eye. On the contrary: Harris has limited her campaign appearances. She hasn't had an official press conference or a solo interview since Biden dropped out. There's something guarded about Harris, a part of herself that she's reluctant or unwilling to reveal. Many voters like her anyway. Harris has benefited from adulatory media, for sure. According to the Media Research Center, she received 84 percent positive coverage in her first month as a candidate, a far cry from Trump's 89 percent negative coverage during the same period. She faced few tough questions, and even fewer follow-ups, during her joint interview with running mate Tim Walz on CNN last week. The Trump campaign has found it difficult to cut through the thicket of stories that celebrate Harris's joy and vibes, her passion for cooking, and her adoring fans.

Keeping up with the changing party line is exhausting. Not long ago, remember, it was considered a slur to suggest that Joe Biden was too old and infirm to be reelected president. In June, when the Wall Street Journal published a detailed report on Biden's memory loss and confusion, the White House denounced the paper and its parent company. Biden's BFFs on MSNBC called the article \"a Trump hit piece.\" Days later, when videos circulated on social media of a stiff and vacant Biden visiting Normandy for the 80th anniversary of D-Day, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the images were \"cheap fakes\" made \"in bad faith.\" The Washington Post published a story headlined \"How Republicans Used Misleading Videos To Attack Biden in a 24-Hour Period.\" Misleading, indeed.

Because Biden's performance did nothing to resolve the Democratic Party's dilemma over his status as its 2024 presidential candidate. The press conference supplied Biden's internal critics with ammunition against his candidacy, such as when he misidentified Kamala Harris as \"Vice President Trump.\" But Biden's answers on foreign-policy questions were also strong enough to reassure, at least for the moment, his allies within the party. The result is that Biden lives to fight another day as the Democrats' presumptive nominee. Which is exactly what Trump wants. Since Biden's terrible debate performance on June 27, the former president has basked in the best of both worlds: Biden has struggled to put down the revolt within his party, while sinking in popularity and trailing Trump in national polling averages as well as in swing states. Prolonging the agony, with liberal media and Hollywood celebrities as well as Democratic congressmen calling for Biden's withdrawal from the ticket or abdication from office, as the president engages in a high-stakes campaign to show he is up to the job, only helps Trump's situation. Democratic divisions will remain in public view. The media's attention will be on the incumbent. And Biden is liable to commit another gaffe, misstep, or brain freeze at any moment.

And if independents are key, then the Trump campaign may want to keep a close eye on recent polling. So far in the 2024 campaign, Donald Trump has enjoyed consistent support from independents despite losing their votes by 13 points in 2020. For example, the April New York Times/Siena poll had Trump winning likely voters overall by 1 point and likely independent voters by 4 points. The April Fox News poll of registered voters had Trump winning registered voters overall by 1 point and independent voters by 2 points. The same pattern is visible in the states. The May Bloomberg/Morning Consult poll of swing states had Trump winning independents and sweeping every battleground except Michigan. And the June Emerson poll of swing states has Trump winning independents, and registered voters overall, in every swing state from Arizona to Pennsylvania. But the Emerson poll also found that independent support for Trump has dropped. He's below 45 percent among independents in Arizona, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. That is enough to beat Biden, for now. It's not enough to put this election away. Trump also lost support from independents in the June Fox News poll. In a wild swing, independents have gone from favoring Trump by 2 points to favoring Biden by 9 points, giving the incumbent a 2-point lead among voters nationwide. These numbers suggest that Trump's felony conviction in New York City hurt his lead. Trump is still ahead in the swing states, where the election will be decided, but in most cases his margins are tight.",

Nixon had won 49 states, losing Massachusetts and Washington, D.C., to Senator George McGovern (D., S.D.). He had won 61 percent of the popular vote. More striking to Buchanan than the size of this \"New American Majority\" was its composition. In addition to the traditional Republican base, Nixon had won over the South (on the presidential level) and the \"ethnic, blue-collar, Catholic, working-class Americans of the North, Midwest, and West.\" Here was Nixon's \"silent majority,\" revealed for all to see. Buchanan's fear was that this majority came into view only on Election Day. By the time votes had been tallied, he wrote, the voices of the \"liberal media\" and other left-wing social and cultural elites were again dominant. Buchanan's postelection memo set out policy objectives that he believed would block the liberals and turn Nixon into the \"Republican FDR, founder and first magistrate of a political dynasty, to dominate American politics long after the President has retired from office.\" I thought about Buchanan's memo while reading coverage of the run-up to Donald Trump's Thursday rally in the Bronx. If Trump defeats President Biden this November and becomes the first president since the 19th century to serve nonconsecutive terms, it will be because Trump, like Nixon, reconfigured the GOP coalition.

His comments also raise the question of what a \"win\" against Iran would really look like—and why America has not pursued that goal. Yes, the technical and operational mastery of the U.S.-led coalition was stunning. America, Israel, the United Kingdom, France, and most significantly Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates intercepted 99 percent of the weapons that Iran launched to kill Jews.

The names of the justices targeted, however, were withheld by the Department of Justice — likely because they confirm Democrats’ incendiary rhetoric against the conservative members of the court is working. The DOJ announced on Thursday that Panos Anastasiou faces nine counts of making threats against a federal judge and 13 counts of making threats in interstate commerce after he sent more than 465 messages pledging harm against justices via “a public website the court maintained.”\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland acknowledged in the Thursday press release that the communications were rooted in Anastasiou’s desire to “retaliate against them for decisions he disagreed with.” Yet, neither he nor the Department of Justice memo announcing the arrest identified exactly which of the nine SCOTUS members and their family members were terrorized. In fact, the DOJ went out of its way in its 11-page September 18 indictment of Anastasiou to disguise which high bench presiders were in danger for upholding their constitutional duties by reducing the justices to numbers “1-6.” Six of the nine sitting SCOTUS justices were nominated to the high bench by Republican presidents. The document accusing the Alaskan of several felonies, however, shows Anastasiou’s threats were well timed not only with a Democrat-manufactured ethics scandal, but also decisions secured specifically by the court’s conservative majority. In May, as corporate media ramped up Democrat-manufactured attacks on Republican-nominated justices like Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, Anastasiou promised “lynching” for the unnamed “Justice 1,” who he previously demanded “hang[]…from an Oak tree,” and swore he would end “Justice 2” and his family’s lives by “putting a bullet in his […] head.” Additionally, Anastasiou expressed hope that Justices 1 and 2 and their families would be killed by “‘fellow veterans’ who ‘spray’ their homes with bullets.”\n\nHours after SCOTUS ruled 6 to 3 on July 1 that presidents have “absolute immunity” for “actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority” and “at least presumptive immunity” for all “official acts,” Anastasiou threatened to “murder,” “torture,” and “execute” six of the justices with “intent to impede, intimidate, and interfere” with the court’s decision-making authority.",

        "text": "For LGBT activists and media, what’s “offensive” can fluctuate based on the political season. Never shy to provide relevant examples, LGBT media demonstrated their dedication to hypocrisy and hierarchy just this week. In a glowing interview with President Joe Biden, the Washington Blade, a legacy LGBT news source, gasped, “Writing about President Joe Biden’s legacy is difficult without the distance and time required to assess a leader of his stature, but what becomes clear from talking with him is the extent to which his views on LGBTQ rights come from the heart.”\n\nFrom there it would seem Biden was the single greatest gift to LGBT-identifying Americans, honoring his administration as the most pro-LGBT in American history. Speaking of LGBT Americans, Biden said, “[M]ost of the openly gay people that have worked with me, that I’ve worked with, the one advantage they have is they tend to have more courage than most people have.”\n\nBiden has the greatest “respect and admiration” for LGBT people. He argued, “[A]ll the LGBTQ+ people that have worked for me or with me have reinforced my view that it’s not what your sexual preference is, it’s what your intellectual capacity is and what your courage is.”\n\nBut wait a minute. Did Biden just refer to LGBT people as having a “sexual preference?” In 2020, when then-Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett innocently uttered the same phrase, it became a national controversy. LGBTQ Nation, using that quote as its subheading for an article praising the president, demanded in 2020, “Barrett used the offensive phrase ‘sexual preference,’ a right-wing dog-whistle that suggests that LGBTQ people can be cured.”\n\nThe use of this phrase, the site argued in its headline, “revealed how biased she is against LGBTQ people.” Barrett used the phrase when saying, “I have no agenda and I do want to be clear that I have never discriminated on the basis of sexual preference and would not ever discriminate on the basis of sexual preference.” Yet this was sufficient to generate outrage headlines in not only LGBT media but across all major news organizations.",

Unfortunately, prosecutors and federal officials are still tallying up the damage. The House Oversight Committee recently released a report summarizing its own findings on the proliferation of pandemic scams. While other federal analyses have focused on the effects at the federal level, the committee report showed how incompetence at the state level, where unemployment benefits actually get administered, sowed the seeds for the Covid-era grifts. Invitation to Criminals\n\nThe House investigation examined how numerous state decisions made identity fraud and other scams a near-certainty. For instance, the report references this nugget from a federal Justice Department press release announcing that a married couple had agreed to plead guilty to wire fraud charges:\n\nAccording to court documents, Tiffany [Pacheco] was hired by the Massachusetts Department of Unemployment Assistance (DUA) in April 2020, shortly after her release from federal prison following a conviction for aggravated identity theft. While employed by DUA, Tiffany allegedly misused her position to submit fraudulent [unemployment] claim information on behalf of herself and her husband, Arthur, who was incarcerated in Texas until September 4, 2020, and thus ineligible for [unemployment] funds. (Emphasis mine.) The only natural response consists of one word: Really? One can read that paragraph over and over again to try to make sense of it — a government agency hiring someone just out of prison after a federal identity fraud conviction and placing her in a position with access to names, Social Security numbers, and other personal information allowing said individual to engage in more identity theft.",

Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said these voters “lean more heavily Republican” and are between 45-60 years old, as reported in the Votebeat article. In Arizona, voters registering via state registration form must provide documentary proof of citizenship (DPOC) to vote in state and local races. Those who are unable to provide such proof are registered as “federal-only” voters and can only cast ballots in federal races. Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer filed a lawsuit with the Arizona Supreme Court on Tuesday, asking that the secretary be forced to classify the 97,000 registrants as “federal-only” voters until they provide DPOC demonstrating their eligibility to vote in state and local elections.",

Now running with the unprecedented endorsement of a legacy Kennedy, the Trump family may soon reclaim White House authority and with it the opportunity to pick up where former First Lady Michelle Obama left off. Childhood obesity represents one of the few issues on which the new Republican White House can reclaim moral authority and also galvanize a bipartisan political movement with a major push to end this destructive epidemic. When the Obama family came into office, the epidemic of childhood obesity catalyzed what at first had seemed an optimistic initiative to tackle the health care crisis plaguing our children. By 2009, nearly 17 percent of children aged 2-19 were obese, representing a striking increase from just 5 percent in 1971. In 2017, the number had grown even higher, with more than 19 percent of children in America, or nearly 1 in 5, struggling with obesity. The number of kids and teens coping with “severe obesity” reached 6 percent for the first time ever by 2013, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The first lady’s movement obviously failed, and the campaign did so for two probable reasons: 1) half the country wrote off the celebrity-infused campaign as an unserious example of nanny-state finger-wagging from elites in D.C., and 2) a conspiracy of food and pharmaceutical interests successfully undermined the program.

It would also allow the new head of Hamas, Yahya Sinwar, to escape – along with many of the hostages with whom he is thought to be surrounding himself for protection -- through the tunnels into Egypt's Sinai Desert. The most recent statement from Hamas makes it clear that the terror group wants Israel to leave the Gaza Strip before any hostages are freed. According to some reports, Hamas has stated that it is willing to free the hostages in stages. It undoubtedly wants to hold on to as many hostages as possible as an \"insurance policy\" that Israel will not resume the war against the terror group and that the terrorist group will be able to have a free hand to attack Israel in the future. This implies that a large number of the hostages remain captive in the hands of the terror group for years. It is important to note that for the past 10 years, Hamas has been holding hostage two Israeli civilians who are believed to be still alive, as well as the remains of two IDF soldiers. Hamas is willing to fight to the last Palestinian. The terror group does not care if tens of thousands of its own people lose their lives as a result of the war it began. Its No. 1 priority is to hold on to power after the war. Hamas is evidently hoping that a ceasefire-hostage deal will help it achieve its goal of retaining control over the Gaza Strip.",

        "text": "Lammy's blatant anti-Israel agenda will also place the UK's long-standing strategic alliance with Israel under intense strain. Having worked closely on a number of vital security issues, such as Iran's nuclear programme and the threat posed by Islamist terrorists, the Israeli government will be disinclined to maintain cooperation with the UK's new Labour government so long as Lammy remains foreign secretary. While Lammy's anti-Israel policies will undoubtedly appeal to the Labour's Party's hard-Left, they are also likely to place Starmer's government on a collision course with Washington, which has concluded there are no grounds for suspending arms deals with Israel, and that the creation of Palestinian state, as agreed in the Oslo Accords, is contingent on successful peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians. His appeal came shortly after a cell of al-Qaeda terrorists had carried out their worst terrorist attack against the UK with the London bombings in July 2005, murdering 72 innocent commuters and wounding more than 700. As a junior minister in Tony Blair's government in 2006, for example, the Harvard-educated Lammy called for the British media to provide a platform for them to air their \"poisonous\" views. Lammy has now added to his anti-Israel stance by suspending a number of UK arms contracts to Israel, a decision that was announced on the same day that Israel buried the latest group of hostages to be murdered by Hamas terrorists, a decision that was denounced by Netanyahu as \"shameful\". At the same time, Lammy confirmed that the UK was to restore its funding to UNRWA, the UN agency responsible for supporting Palestinian refugees, after support for the organisation was withdrawn by a number of countries -- including the US -- over claims its staffers were directly involved in the October 7 attacks carried out by Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists against Israel.",

        "text": "Israel's True Enemy: Hamas, Not Netanyahu More than 30 years ago, these \"elites,\" overwhelmingly on Israel's political \"left\" (think \"peace,\" as if most people in democracies do not want peace) played a significant role in convincing the Israeli government to sign the Oslo Accord with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), headed by Yasser Arafat. The assumption back then was that if you bring Arafat's PLO from the Arab countries to Gaza and the West Bank and help them create a government and police force, the Palestinians would renounce terrorism and give up their dream of destroying Israel. The Palestinian Authority, established in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1994, had no intention of making peace with Israel, and still has not. Palestinian leaders continue to praise terrorists as \"martyrs\" and \"heroes\" and pay monthly salaries to their families. Many Israeli \"elites\" chose to turn a blind eye to the Palestinian leaders' support for terrorism and incitement of violence and hatred against Israel. Some Israeli peace activists continued to argue that Abbas who, since 2014 has refused to resume peace negotiations with Israel, is somehow a credible peace partner. \"He [Arafat] did not negotiate in good faith; indeed, he did not negotiate at all. He just kept saying no to every offer, never making any counterproposals of his own.\" – Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, quoted by Benny Morris from interviews in late March and early April 2202. The Israeli pullout from the Gaza Strip in 2005 to enable the Palestinians to create a Dubai on the Mediterranean, instead enabled Hamas and other terror groups to turn the coastal enclave into a huge base for Jihad (holy war) against Israel.",

Their core claim is that Netanyahu is prolonging the war and condemning the hostages to death solely to appease extremists in his coalition and thus remain in power. Of course, everyone desperately wants the hostages brought back home. But the idea that the ceasefire deal would achieve this is sheer fantasy. Only a few of the hostages would be released in the first phase. Hamas would then use the ceasefire to regroup and rearm, spinning out the continuing negotiation farce to keep the rest of the hostages trapped and thus retain control of the Gaza Strip. It would only ever release all the hostages (if at all) with Israel's total surrender. That's what those calling for an immediate ceasefire deal are actually promoting. The only way to save the hostages is through military pressure. That's one reason why it's imperative for Israel to retain control of the Philadelphi corridor, the area of Gaza that borders Egypt. The importance of this corridor cannot be exaggerated. Israel's capture of it has uncovered deep below its surface an extensive infrastructure of giant tunnels into Egypt — thus revealing the principal route through which Hamas imported its rockets, weapons and ammunition. [Emphasis added]\n\nHamas needs to control the Philadelphi corridor in order to resupply itself. Without that, it will be finished.",

While scholars and journalists have traced ties between academic institutions and U.S. defense companies, it is important to point out that relations between universities and the U.S. military are not always mediated by the corporate industrial sector.1 American universities and the U.S. military are also linked directly and organizationally, as seen with what the Department of Defense (DoD) calls “University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs).” UARCs are strategic programs that the DoD has established at fifteen different universities around the country to sponsor research and development in what the Pentagon terms “essential engineering and technology capabilities.”2 Established in 1996 by the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, UARCs function as nonprofit research organizations at designated universities aimed to ensure that those capabilities are available on demand to its military agencies. While there is a long history of scientific and engineering collaboration between universities and the U.S. government dating back to the Second World War, UARCs reveal the breadth and depth of today’s military-university complex, illustrating how militarized knowledge production emerges from within the academy and without corporate involvement. UARCs demonstrate one of the less visible yet vital ways in which these students’ institutions help perpetuate the cycle of U.S.-led wars and empire-building.",

Microfinance has become a salient sector for poverty reduction in the developing world since its inception in the 1980s. By recruiting women into a group and making this entity a contract for continuous credit, microfinance includes many people who are beyond the reach of the formal bank sector due to a lack of formal guarantees for financial services. The group meets regularly to pay the debt and women supervise each other in handing in the money each time. This model provides loans at a rate higher than the formal bank but lower than the informal lender, making it workable as a business, as well as seemingly inclusive. Furthermore, it claims to empower women since it provides credit directly to women, making them protagonists in that respect. The United Nations advocates for this model. The inventor of the model, Muhammad Yunus, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006. Nowadays, the worldwide industry has grown to be valued at $200 billion. It is also estimated that it will reach a size of $506 billion by 2030.1\n\nAs an industry prominent in the development sector, microfinance has always been controversial. In the context of India, where the industry reaches sixty million people, microfinance is justified by the central bank for its “financial inclusion.” However, the industry is also believed to apply coercion toward those who are unable to pay the debt, leading to peasant suicides.",

He is the author (with John Bellamy Foster) of The Robbery of Nature (Monthly Review Press, 2020). Indo-Pacific is a term with a long history within the imperialist lexicon. It originated in the writings of Karl Haushofer, the leading German geopolitical theorist, in his 1924 Geopolitics of the Pacific Ocean and numerous other works.1 Haushofer was a German military attaché in Japan in 1908–1909, and traveled widely in East Asia. As a result of these experiences, he was to emerge as a major geopolitical analyst. He served as a brigade commander in the First World War, rising to the rank of major general by the war’s end. Rudolf Hess, who had been Haushofer’s aide-de-camp and later his student, was one of his chief disciples. In 1920, Hess joined the Nazi Party. Following the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch, when Adolf Hitler and Hess were confined to the prison in the Fortress of Landsberg, Haushofer instructed both of them in geopolitics, while Hitler dictated Mein Kampf to Hess. A decade later, when Hitler came to power in Germany, Hess was appointed Deputy Führer of the Nazi Party. A special professorship in defense geography was created for Haushofer at the University of Munich.2\n\nThe designation of the Indo-Pacific as a geopolitical region arose in Haushofer’s global imperial strategy, aimed at carving out a new “Pan-region” (similar to Pan-America under U.S. hegemony) in the Far East, to be led by Germany, Japan, and Russia/USSR.",

In the Western imagination, Taiwan exists as little more than a staging ground for ideological war with the People’s Republic of China (PRC)—a crossroads of democracy versus authoritarianism, Western values versus Chinese backwardness, and free market capitalism versus closed-door communism. Yet for centuries, the island of Taiwan has played a rich and pivotal role in broader Chinese history. Located just one hundred miles from the mainland’s southeastern coast, Taiwan was linked to the mainland through migration, trade, language, and culture long before European and Japanese colonizers seized on its strategic location as a launchpad for economic and military forays against China at large. Today, this history continues as U.S. imperialism positions Taiwan as an ideological and military base for its new Cold War against China.1\n\nTaiwan’s separation from the Chinese mainland began in 1895, when the Qing government was forced to cede Taiwan to Japan after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War. While Japan’s surrender at the end of the Second World War legally restored Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan, the Chinese Civil War and the global Cold War once again rendered Taiwan an instrument for imperial ambitions against China. For the ascendant postwar United States, the 1949 establishment of the PRC under the Communist Party of China (CPC) marked the “loss of China”—a blow only partially recouped by propping up the fleeing Chiang Kai-shek government in Taiwan as “Free China.” In 1950, as the United States waged war to prevent the socialist unification of Korea, President Harry S. Truman dispatched the U.S. Navy’s Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait to similarly foreclose the possibility of a unified socialist China.",

In his New Year’s address on January 15, 2024, North Korean Workers’ Party Chairman Kim Jong-un proposed removing from North Korea’s socialist constitution the notions of South and North Koreans as compatriots and the pursuit of peaceful reunification.1 Furthermore, he argued that North Korea’s education should teach students that South Korea is the North’s main enemy state.2 While denying that this was an announcement for reunification through preemptive attack, Kim stated that if war broke out, North Korea would occupy, subjugate, and reclaim South Korea.3 This speech severed ties with the more than thirty years of peaceful reunification pursued by North Korea’s two previous leaders. Since the early 1990s, North Korea has sought the normalization of relations with the United States and peaceful reunification with South Korea. During that time, inter-Korean relations ebbed and flowed. But North Korea’s changed inter-Korean policy moves away from peaceful reunification and toward war in the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia. If we are to chart our way back to peace, we must understand the motivations that led to such a shift and the historical and geopolitical processes that have led us to our current moment: the failed peace negotiations with the United States, the historical and social limits of South Korean politics, and the intensifying polarization of Northeast Asia due to U.S. military escalation. Abolitionist Frederick Douglass famously said that “power concedes nothing without a demand.”4 Peace movements must organize around a common set of demands against war: opposing the U.S. military escalation that is dividing the region into camps; overcoming the structural limitations of South Korea that keeps it dependent upon the United States; and coalescing frontline struggles within South Korea and the region into a common struggle against U.S. military escalations.",

The former President also brought up Minnesota more than once, and got the facts wrong whenever he did. It’s true that Minnesota’s national profile has risen significantly in recent years. Our Democratic governor, Tim Walz, became Harris’s running mate in August, leading to a flood of interest in both Walz and the state he’s presided over since 2018. And before that, Minneapolis became the epicenter of a global Black Lives Matter movement in 2020 after George Floyd was murdered there that same year. Walz has clearly gotten under the skin of both Trump and his running mate, Republican Senator J.D. Vance. Maybe it’s Walz’s popularity, both as a governor and as a vice presidential candidate. On that front, he’s got Vance beat by quite a margin. A recent poll from USA Today and Suffolk University found that Walz ranks much higher than Vance with nearly every category of voter. Only 15 percent of Black voters polled found Vance appealing, for example, while more than half approved of Walz. When Harris brought up reproductive choice during the September 10 debate, Trump launched into a deranged sounding rant against Walz, claiming the Democratic vice presidential pick not only supports allowing abortions in the ninth month of pregnancy, but also the execution of newborn babies.",

Climate change, compounded by conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, threatens an oil disaster off the coast of Alaska, potentially devastating Indigenous communities and the nation’s richest fishing grounds. This danger arises from increasing oil traffic between Russia and China through Arctic waters bordering the United States. On August 29, Houthi rebels in Yemen attacked the Greek-flagged oil tanker Sounion in the Red Sea. A month later, it continues to burn and threaten a catastrophic oil spill, according to the United Nations. This incident is part of a broader trend of increased Houthi attacks on shipping since the Gaza war began. To avoid these dangers, many vessels are now rerouting around the southern tip of Africa. However, oil shipments have also been increasing through the Russian-controlled Northern Sea Route (NSR) in the Arctic, a pathway made navigable by melting sea ice due to climate change. In late August, the Azerbaijani-run Prisma, the largest crude oil tanker to use the NSR through the Arctic Ocean and the Chukchi and Bering Seas, transited from Russia to China carrying some one million barrels of oil on board and passing through the fifty-five-mile-wide Bering Strait between mainland Russia and the state of Alaska. Until then, all oil traffic on this route has been carried by Russian tankers as a way to help fund the war in Ukraine. China has become the largest buyer of cheap Russian crude oil, purchasing 52 percent of it since Western sanctions were imposed on Russia following its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.",

If harvests do not reduce numbers, the NPS will remove additional bison through the TFTP. When the population is below 5,200, the NPS will only place bison in the BCTP and use the TFTP to remove brucellosis-positive bison that are identified when animals are selected for the BCTP.

The shooter has been identified by the Park County, Wyoming coroner as Samson Lucas Bariah Fussner, 28, of Milton, Florida. Fussner died after an exchange of gunfire with law enforcement. The investigation into this incident, including the actions of the National Park Service (NPS) law enforcement rangers, is being led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and will be reviewed by the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Wyoming. Just after midnight on July 4, Yellowstone’s 911 dispatch center received a report that a woman had been held against her will by a man with a gun in a residence at Canyon Village. She also reported to law enforcement rangers that Fussner threatened to kill her and others, including plans to allegedly carry out a mass shooting(s) at July 4th events outside the park.

The court also ordered Pyshniuk to pay a $1,500 fine, $30 mandatory court processing fee and $20 special assessment.According to court documents, a YNP law enforcement officer was dispatched to the thermal area at Steamboat Geyser by an on-duty park employee who reported a person walking off the boardwalk at that location. The employee had taken a photo of the defendant who had clearly crossed over the fence and was walking up the hillside within 15-20 feet of Steamboat Geyser’s steam vent. When contacted, Pyshniuk told the officer he left the boardwalk to take photos. While speaking with Pyshniuk, the officer showed him the signs posted throughout the area stating it is illegal to leave the boardwalk and explained that walking in a thermal area is very dangerous due to possible weak ground layer, the geothermal features of mud pots, heated steam and water, and all other dangers associated with walking in a heated, unpredictable geothermal area.Magistrate Judge Stephanie A.

None of the trap sites in the park will be located near established hiking trails or backcountry campsites, and all trap sites will have posted warnings for the closure perimeter. Potential access points will also be posted with bright warning signs for the closure area. It is critical that the public heed these signs. Backcountry users who come upon any of these posted areas need to stay out of the area.Monitoring of grizzly bear distribution and other activities are vital to ongoing recovery of grizzly bears in the Yellowstone Ecosystem. In order to attract bears, biologists use natural food sources such as fresh road-killed deer and elk. Potential capture sites are baited with these natural foods and if indications are that grizzly bears are in the area, culvert traps or foot snares will be used to capture the bears. Once captured, bears are handled in accordance with strict safety and animal care protocols developed by the IGBST.Whenever bear capture activities are being conducted for scientific purposes, the area around the site will be posted with bright warning signs to inform the public of the activities occurring.",

U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephanie A. Hambrick imposed the sentence on March 14, in Mammoth, Wyoming. Mr. Brosnan pleaded guilty to foot travel in a thermal area. According to court documents, on or about Nov. 1, 2023, Brosnan uploaded pictures to his Instagram page of himself standing on a Yellowstone National Park thermal feature at Mammoth Hot Springs. There are signs posted in the area that warn visitors of the dangers of thermal features and state that visitors must remain on the designated boardwalks and trails. The United States Attorney’s Office asked the court to sentence Brosnan to 2 years’ probation and the maximum fine of $5,000. The National Park Service (NPS) reminds Yellowstone visitors that the ground in thermal areas is fragile and thin, and scalding water is just below the surface. Therefore, trespassing on thermal features is dangerous and can harm delicate natural resources within the park. Additionally, the park was established primarily to protect these hydrothermal areas. NPS encourages visitors to exercise extreme caution around thermal features by staying on boardwalks and trails.

Frank\n\nMarch 7, 2024\n\nContact: Morgan Warthin, (307) 344-2015\n\nMAMMOTH HOT SPRINGS, WY – Yellowstone National Park seeks public comment on proposed measures to help stop the spread of aquatic invasive species (AIS) into park waters. The proposals include a 30-day mandatory dry time for some types of motorized boats and sailboats before entering park waters and the prohibition of watercraft previously fouled by mussels regardless of dry time.Yellowstone faces an increased risk of invasion by highly invasive zebra and quagga mussels following recent detections (2022 Pactola Reservoir, South Dakota, and 2023 Snake River, Twin Falls, Idaho) in waterways within a day’s drive of the park. Mussels have caused irreversible ecological damage and extensive impacts to infrastructure and recreation in waterways throughout the Midwestern and Eastern United States, as well as in the lower Colorado River Basin. In both 2022 and 2023, Yellowstone’s AIS inspectors intercepted and denied launch to mussel-fouled watercraft, highlighting the urgency and severity of the threat.To protect park waters and respond to this threat, Yellowstone proposes a 30-day dry time requirement for complex, motorized boats (inboard, inboard/outboard, and inboard jet) and sailboats prior to launching. Large, complex, trailered watercraft pose the highest risk of transporting and introducing invasive mussels and other AIS because they are difficult to inspect and less likely to completely drain/dry or be fully decontaminated. Manual decontamination with the use of hot water is not always 100% effective in removing all mussels. A 30-day dry time will mitigate the risk.Watercraft (motorized or non-motorized) previously fouled by mussels, regardless of dry time, would be denied launch.",

As they moved into modern-day Ghana, and anxious about French and German influence over the area, they offered to extend a protectorate over the Ashanti people. The Ashanti King (Asantehene) Prempeh I, who had ascended to the throne in 1888, refused in order to protect Ashanti sovereignty. Trying to avoid a military confrontation, Prempeh I offered concessions on trade from his kingdom via an embassy sent to London. However, in 1895 the British instead launched what they called the “Second Ashanti Expedition” to take over the territory.\n\nConfronted with the British troops, Prempeh I was forced to sign a treaty of protection. The British then arrested him and sent him into exile in 1896. Prempeh I spent the first four years of exile in the British colony of Freetown in Sierra Leone, in a house at 9 Howe Street. Besides himself, the monarch was detained with several members of his court.\n\nIn 1900, the “War of the Golden Stool” broke out as the British extended their rule over the Ashanti kingdom. Fearing the proximity to his former kingdom, the British then sent Prempeh I to the Seychelles, where he remained until his return from exile in 1924.\n\nAlthough the house where Prempeh I stayed is long gone, in 2005 the Sierra Leone Monuments and Relics Commission placed a plaque on the spot, commemorating the Asantehene’s stay. There ceremony was attended by the Ghananian High Commissioner to Sierra Leone.",

On it is a sign that reads: “From Cluny Hill witches were rolled in stout barrels through which spikes were driven. Where the barrels stopped they were burned with their mangled contents. This stone marks the site of one such burning.” Though there is no date mentioned, there are theories that it is associated with a story involving King Duncan who was said to have been bewitched in the 11th century. It also can be attributed to what is often referred to as Scotland’s 16th-century witch craze. Under the Scottish Witchcraft Act 1563, the practice of witchcraft and consulting with witches were both considered capital offenses\n\nDuring the period that followed, the country saw an estimated 4,000 people put to death, accused of practicing the dark arts. These governmental sanctioned acts of cruelty eventually ceased during the Reformation. The law was not overturned until the middle of the 18th century. One may also notice that the large stone is broken in several places and held together with a giant metal clasp. It has been suggested that boulder was initially broken up to be used towards the construction of several homes. But when the occupants became ill, the stones were returned to the original location, possibly out of suspicion that the stone held a curse.",

Irrigation projects, under the rubric of “reclamation,” were all the rage during the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the Western United States. A degree of federal support was furnished by the Carey Act (or Federal Desert Lands Act) of 1894, which provided a way to deed Federal lands to farmers if some percentage was irrigated. The program was to be overseen by the states and the details varied, but overall private companies were to build infrastructure and sell rights to land and water, with the Federal government finally transferring the land when sufficient irrigation had been established. Tumalo (pronounced “TUM-uh-loh”) Creek, a tributary of the Deschutes River west of Bend, Oregon, was an early focus of irrigation ventures. In a harbinger of things to come, around the turn of the last century, Three Sisters Irrigation Co. proposed diverting for irrigation far more water than actually flows in the creek. Promoter and scam artist William A. Laidlaw showed up in 1902 and incorporated all the previous ventures into the Columbia Southern Irrigation Co. The company platted the town of Laidlaw and began selling irrigation lands and theoretical water rights—despite how little infrastructure had been built. Some 18,000 acres had been sold by 1907, but only about a thousand were ever actually irrigated. The company made off with some $475,000 (equivalent to about $13 million in 2015), of which Laidlaw personally kept some $116,000. The infuriated, and scammed, settlers hanged Laidlaw in effigy and later renamed the townsite “Tumalo” (as it remains today), but the money was never recovered.",

        "text": "Charles Rennie Mackintosh and his wife Margaret Macdonald were both members of The Four, a quartet from Glasgow that included Margaret’s sister Frances and her husband James Herbert MacNair. The Four met at the Glasgow School of Art when they studied there at the end of the 19th century. The men were architecture students who incorporated Art Nouveau into their designs, leading to a distinctive Glasgow Style. The Mackintoshes lived in a house at 6 Florentine Terrace, in the Hillhead neighborhood, close to the current location of the Hunterian Art Gallery.\n\nIronically, many buildings including the Mackintosh home were demolished to make way for new buildings of the University of Glasgow, which runs the Hunterian. When 6 Florentine Terrace was demolished in the 1960s, the legacy of the late Mackintoshes was already well-established, so it was decided that the furnishings of most of the house would be preserved and documented as best as possible.\n\nThanks to this foresight, the Hunterian was able to recreate several of the rooms of their house. The restored dining room, bedroom, hall, and other spaces feature the original furniture and decorations of the Mackintoshes along with some reproductions for lost items. The Mackintosh House opened as a part of the Hunterian Gallery in 1981, allowing visitors to get a sense of the life of these famous Glasgow artists.",

No longer in flying condition, it sits propped up on concrete pillars behind a wall topped with barbed wire. While the breakaway republic of Somaliland seems like a strange final resting place for a mid-century Soviet aircraft, even less likely is the fact that it’s now a cafe. This is Guluf Airline Restaurant, a Somali “airline” whose only plane will never fly again, and you’re welcome to come inside for a meal or a cup of tea. The Ilyushin Il-18V airplane was produced between 1959 and 1965, and was widely exported to USSR-friendly countries. This particular Il-18V was used for 29 years from 1962 to 1991 by TAROM, Romania’s government-owned airline, outliving Romania’s communist regime by a year and a half. It was retired and kept in storage for seven years, until it returned to the sky in May 1998 for a new life of crime. Infamous Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout, AKA the Merchant of Death, purchased it and relocated it to Africa, where he almost surely used it to transport weapons to western African nations in violation of international arms embargoes. From there, the plane eventually changed hands a couple more times, and was still flying as late as 2007. After 45 years, it was finally retired for good after an incident where the landing gear initially refused to extend on descent. Stored near the Hargeisa airport for the better part of a decade, it wasn’t until 2016 that a local entrepreneur bought it and turned it into a place to eat Somali cuisine.",

Arranged like fat cigars with perhaps a sprinkle of nuts, the pancakes have an understated elegance verging on austere. But Jeremy Salamon, the chef behind Agi’s Counter in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, first tried these spongy crêpes not in Budapest but in Boca Raton, Florida, where his grandmother made them with a maximalist flair. Grandma Agi, as Salamon calls his paternal grandmother, transformed the dish into a “DIY party,” where everyone could assemble their own perfect bites from a spread of homemade jams, chocolate sauce, whipped cream, nuts, and sugars scented with cinnamon or rose. And in lieu of bone china, Grandma Agi opted for melamine plates adorned with Walt Disney or McDonald’s characters. “It was so much fun. You could just go to town and make it really messy and roll it up,” Salamon says. His grandmother’s crêpes are one of 100 recipes in Second Generation: Hungarian And Jewish Classics Reimagined For The Modern Table, his debut cookbook. “It was a very Americanized version of the dish. That’s why I call it ‘Palacsinta Americana.’ A lot of the recipes come from a very personal place and a nostalgic place.”\n\nChef Jeremy Salamon puts his own personal touch on traditional Hungarian and Jewish recipes.

With maze-like mangrove tunnels teeming with marine life, small islands found along the coasts, and places to float alongside manatees, the southeasternmost state is paradise for travelers looking to immerse themselves in nature with paddle in hand. Step 1: Choose Your Craft\n\nThere are multiple ways to get out on the water without diving in, so it’s important to choose the right kind of vessel, both for your skill and comfort level and for the conditions. Kayaks and canoes tend to be better for cooler seasons and windy conditions. They have space for supplies, are better for long distances, are more stable, and can sometimes accommodate two people, making them ideal for paddling with a friend. On the other hand, stand-up paddle boards let riders see the sights from a higher vantage point. They are great for warm weather, offer a good workout, and allow tremendous freedom of movement. If you don’t have your own SUP or kayak, there are plenty of places to rent one and to see what suits you best. Step 2: Map the Route\n\nIt’s easy to get swept up in the excitement of exploring a destination teeming with wildlife, fish, and unique landscapes. However, it’s important to consider changing tides and the fact that it can be easy to get turned around. Research where you’ll be going ahead of time and map how to get back to your starting point. It’s always safer to paddle with a partner and to let someone on land know where you’ll be.",

From Cape Canaveral on the Atlantic to the westernmost Keys, incredible flora and fauna are waiting to be discovered, including enormous loggerhead sea turtles, diminutive Key deer, rare Florida panthers, elusive ghost orchids, and exotic Roseate Spoonbills. Use these tips to make the most of your Florida wildlife adventure:\n\nPlan for the seasons. Winter is an ideal time to view animals, when heat and humidity are lower and millions of migratory birds are overwintering. During this dry season, which begins in November and extends to May, it’s easier to see animals gathering at watering holes. The wet season, from June to October, can present challenges like afternoon thunderstorms, heat and humidity, and difficulty viewing animals that are moving to drier grounds. Stay alert. Alligators and snakes abound in Florida and play vital roles in the ecosystem. They are rarely aggressive towards people unless provoked, so stay on trails, read park signs, and make sure everyone in your crew is paying close attention to their surroundings. Don’t rely on your phone for everything. If you end up with no cell coverage or your battery runs out, you may not be able to access trail apps or other tools. Study park guides before heading out or take a printed trail map. Binoculars and SLR cameras with telephoto lenses are still the most effective ways to view and photograph wildlife. Keep a journal. You may not be a serious birder right now, or you may not care whether that was an armadillo or opossum that just crossed your path, but jot down a few notes anyway so you can look back later and recall which species you witnessed and where.",

What do you do when there’s a room in your house that’s too ugly for words? I like my apartment. However, a past landlord must have blindfolded themselves before setting out to renovate the bathroom and kitchen, both of which have uneven shelves, sloppy paint jobs, hard-to-reach light switches, and sad vinyl flooring. To distract myself from all these faults, I’ve had to get creative with decor. I started with the bathroom, covering nearly every inch of the walls with a silly assortment of gilt-edged prints of Renaissance angels, Lisa Frank tigers, and a print of Edvard Munch’s The Scream that faces anyone coming out of the shower. I’ve since moved on to my kitchen, where I’ve decided to cover the walls with art that relates to food: people cooking or eating, or simply food by itself. It’s been a fascinating quest to find beautiful and interesting art for this project. Some museum websites have a dedicated page for food-related works in their collections. Others require a dig through webpages for images from long-ago exhibitions. So this week, I’m taking you along with me to explore one of my current favorite things: artists immortalizing food and the act of eating through art.

Imagine an Easter egg hunt in the dark—except the eggs can run away from you. That’s what the puffling season is like on Heimaey, a volcanic island in the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago along the southern coast of Iceland. Every year in mid-September, lost and confused baby puffins wander the streets at night. “They’re everywhere,” says Audrey Padgett, manager of the Sea Life Trust Beluga Whale Sanctuary in Heimaey. “It feels like puffins are raining from the sky.”\n\nHeimaey is home to the world’s largest puffin colony. The neon-billed birds have dug more than a million burrows along the island’s steep, grassy cliffs, which rise above the town of 4,500 people. Once a source of food for islanders, they have more recently become some of Iceland’s most famous residents, attracting tourists and serving as unofficial mascots for the whole country. (Stuffed toy versions of the birds have become so ubiquitous as souvenirs that stores geared toward tourists are colloquially known as “puffin shops.”)\n\nWhile puffins spend most of the year at sea, bobbing on the water and diving for fish, they return to the same burrow every summer to breed. From mid-April to early May, puffin pairs—who mate for life—can be spotted coming ashore to get comfy, lay eggs, and raise their chicks, who are known as pufflings. A group of puffins on Heimaey.",

Legend has it that, in the late Middle Ages, a lay brother named Jakob invented the stuffed pasta dumplings at the Maulbronn Monastery, a UNESCO World Heritage site founded in 1147 by Cistercian monks in southwest Germany. One direct translation of Maultaschen is “mouth pockets,” though “Maul” could just as easily refer to Maulbronn. Maultaschen are usually square dumplings (though sometimes they’re rolled) and can be fried in a pan or served in broth. Commonly described as Germany’s version of Italian ravioli, they allegedly emerged as a way to use up an unexpected bounty of meat that Brother Jakob stumbled upon in the forest outside the monastery walls. The twist? Although they abhorred waste, these monks weren’t allowed to eat the meat of four-legged animals, especially during the Catholic fasting period of Lent in the spring. So Brother Jakob minced the meat with herbs and onions and wrapped everything inside pasta dough, hiding the forbidden flesh from the eyes of his fellow monks—and even from the eyes of God. In Swabia, the region encompassing much of Baden-Württemberg and part of Bavaria where Maultaschen originated, one of the colloquial names for the food references this deception directly: Herrgottsbescheißerle means “little God-cheaters.”\n\nEveryone in Swabia has their version of the legend with more or less embellishment. Ludwig Nestler holds a master’s degree in heritage conservation and works for the State Palaces and Gardens of Baden-Württemberg, a government organization that oversees monuments like Maulbronn Monastery. His version of the tale includes a sack of stolen meat dropped in the woods by a fleeing thief, which inspires Brother Jakob’s trickery in the kitchen.",

Oyo, the India-based hotel giant, has agreed to acquire the Motel 6 and Studio 6 hotel brands from Blackstone for $525 million in an all-cash deal, Blackstone said in a press release. The big picture: This acquisition marks a second attempt by Oyo to expand in the U.S. market ahead of the Softbank-backed startup’s ongoing effort to go public in India.

The inn, designed to reflect local architecture, involved the island's 2,500 residents in its creation and is owned by Shorefast, a charity Cobb established.

To create the Fogo Island Inn, Cobb called on the remote island’s 2,500 residents to contribute their ideas to boost the local economy with tourism while not disrupting their way of life. The high-end inn has three Michelin keys and was designed to look like a local home on stilts with wood in keeping with the island’s traditional style.

Business is way up, yet housekeeping services have been scaled back—sometimes you won't receive much hospitality at all. Amenities are being cut. Guests aren't getting fresh towels, trash isn't being emptied, breakfasts are being cut back, and front desk staffing is often inadequate, multiplying normal wait times. At many hotels, customers are still being charged resort fees despite the cutbacks. Don't blame the hotel staff—there aren't enough of them anymore. According to Unite Here, a group representing about 40,000 hospitality employees, staffing at American hotels went down 13% from 2019 to 2022 even though room rates have ballooned by 20%. Many hotels have maintained their skimpy staffing levels from Covid-19 despite a giant upswing in travel. Despite being full, U.S. hotels employ some 200,000 fewer workers now than before the pandemic, and the workers who remain are seeing their hours cut, minimizing opportunities for overtime. So employees are being forced to do the jobs of several people—without an increase in pay. Amid all those challenges, hotel workers face the same price inflation and rent increases that have slammed all of us. What's more, about 9 in 10 housekeeping workers in the U.S. are women, racial minorities, or immigrant workers, according to federal statistics.

The U.S. State Department has announced that passport renewal via its website is officially open as of Wednesday, September 18, 2024. Until now, when a U.S. passport expired or was close to expiration, American passport holders were forced to go through the laborious process of arranging to have new passport photos taken, printing government forms, and assembling an application packet (including a check, the old passport, and other identification documents) to mail to a distant government address. Then they waited. The ordeal was like applying for a new passport all over again. All of that is in the past—including a good chunk of the waiting. In late 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order calling for the creation of a digital renewal system that would allow Americans so simply request a passport renewal from the comfort of their own homes. \"Every interaction between the Federal Government and the public, whether it involves renewing a passport or calling for a status update on a farm loan application, should be seen as an opportunity for the Government to save an individual’s time (and thus reduce 'time taxes') and to deliver the level of service that the public expects and deserves,\" the order stated. By late 2022, the first beta version of the passport renewal system opened for testing to a small group of guinea pigs, and there was strict daily limit for applications. Following a few periods when the nascent system was temporarily withdrawn for tinkering, the finished passport renewal portal has finally been declared ready for everyone, without daily caps on participants, and for good.",

But we've all moved on by now, right? When it comes to memories, after all, it's wise to heed the words of whichever Left Bank philosophe said, \"You've got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em.\" Apparently, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo didn't get le memo. Hidalgo wants the Eiffel Tower to continue sporting the five big colorful Olympic rings that were affixed to the landmark for the Summer Games, which ended August 11, and Paralympic Games, which ended September 8. The mayor's plans would keep the rings on the tower until \"at least 2028,\" when the next Olympic Games will be held in Los Angeles, reports CBS News. Until 2028 at least? Does that mean the rings could become a permanent fixture? “The decision is up to me,\" Hidalgo told local news media, \"and I have the agreement of the IOC [International Olympic Committee]. So, yes, they [the rings] will stay on the Eiffel Tower.”\n\nOpposition to Making Olympic Rings on Eiffel Tower Permanent\n\nBut other politicians, landmark preservation groups, ordinary Parisians, and the descendants of the tower's designer are less than thrilled with the idea. The family of Gustave Eiffel, the engineer credited with devising the tower that bears his name, strongly opposes leaving the rings up indefinitely. In a statement released through the family's foundation, AGDE, Eiffel's descendants argue that the Olympic symbol shouldn't remain because it is \"colourful, large in size, placed on the main avenue of approach to the tower [and] creates a strong imbalance\" in the landmark's shape, \"substantially modifying the very pure forms of the monument.\"",

First, check prices for all airports in the area you want to visit—for example, prices to Fort Lauderdale are often much cheaper than ones to Miami, just 30 miles away. Second, turn on flexible date search if you can. You may find your deal simply requires leaving 12 hours later than you'd figured.\n\nAlso check the app/website Hopper (pictured) or the websites Fareness and Skyscanner to get a sense of what the airfare normally costs across the calendar.

They're attempting to re-create in live action the Temple Run video game, which was first released in 2011 and centers on an explorer dashing through stone ruins while pursued by demonic monkeys. Because Temple Run's animation resembles the 900-year-old Angkor ruins, social media users can create easily recognizable replicas of the game by speeding along the UNESCO World Heritage Site's stone pathways, leaping to collect imaginary coins, and rushing headlong into stone chambers and narrow corridors. Many of the clips use sounds from the game and some feature overlays of Temple Run graphics. What wit. There are at least two big problems with the trend, however. First, Angkor's more than 100 Hindu-Buddhist temples make up what UNESCO describes as \"one of the most important archaeological sites in South-East Asia.\" Spreading across 400 acres and dating back almost a millennium, the temples of the complex contain priceless carvings and sculptures that could be damaged by TikTokkers crashing around the place just because nobody gave them enough attention when they were children. “It’s nonsense,” conservationist Hans Leisen, who has worked for decades to preserve Angkor Wat's sculptures, told Bloomberg. “If you’re running through the temple, you will not see the beauty of the carvings. And if you fall or stumble, you’ll touch a wall to stabilize yourself and endanger the fragile carvings.”\n\nWhat's more—and this is the second big problem with the Temple Run videos—the trend is profoundly disrespectful to the site's cultural and religious significance.",

It’s all in the fine print—if you can find it. I have spent 39 years working in the travel industry, writing about travel, and advocating for travelers, but just like everyone, I still get caught off guard by consumer gotchas. No matter how much I know about travel, there are always new hurdles to overcome. I made a new discovery on a road trip vacation last week after I thought I had properly purchased car rental insurance protection. The coverage I booked through Expedia turned out not to work for the rental car company I chose. How travel booking sites sell you insurance\n\nFor my trip, I had shopped online before booking a 6-day rental of a compact car from Thrifty on Expedia for $229.23, including all mandatory taxes and fees. I knew I would be driving quite a bit—more than 1,000 miles throughout the Southwest—so I thought it best to buy insurance coverage, and I opted for the “rental car protection” option that popped up during the booking. The policy was flagged by Expedia as “Highly recommended” and it even required a mandatory opt in/opt out before my booking could even be completed. I selected the package that included coverage for “certain theft, vandalism, and collision damage” for $10.00 per day, totaling $60.00. Therefore, my total charge, car and insurance, would be $289.23. Imagine my surprise when I arrived at the rental counter in San Antonio.

The video evidence accompanying the claim certainly makes a convincing case, showing nightmarish check-in lines, with hundreds of guests clogging hotel lobbies at properties owned by Caesars Entertainment. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jen G. (@vegasstarfish)\n\nIn a voiceover, the video's creator says the footage was captured on a Tuesday—not during a busy weekend—and a \"couple hours\" after hotel staff had begun processing new arrivals at the standard late-afternoon check-in time. \"These people are each looking at a several hour wait,\" the narration says. Check-in Lines at Caesars Resorts Reportedly the Worst in Vegas\n\nThe hotels shown in the clip are Horseshoe Las Vegas and Paris Las Vegas, both part of the Caesars Entertainment empire, which owns nearly 21,000 hotel rooms in Vegas across brands and resorts including (deep breath) Caesars Palace, the Cromwell, Flamingo, Harrah's, Horseshoe, the Linq, Nobu, Paris, and Planet Hollywood. For months, eyewitness accounts on social media and online message boards have suggested that the problem of interminable check-in lines is especially bad at Caesars-owned properties. Last summer, a guest attempting to check in at Caesars Palace chronicled an epic wait that started at 7pm, stretched into the wee hours, and finally ended with the guest booking a room elsewhere. Even setting that aside as a worst-case scenario, it's not hard to find online commenters citing 90-minute check-in waits at the Caesars-owned Paris resort or describing a half-hour wait to check in at Horseshoe as a mere starting point.",

We'll give you the advice you need to plan a trip the whole family can enjoy—and remember for a lifetime. Parc Asterix 2005\n\nParc Asterix, Plailly, France Why would a family who took the trouble to fly all the way to France ever go to Disneyland Paris? You could just as easily go to a real French theme park that's just as much (if not more) fun: Parc Asterix . Granted, English-speaking children may not be familiar with these comic book characters. But you don't have to read Asterix comics to get the gist of the thing; it's enough to know that the characters are goofy Gauls living under the rule of the Roman Empire, which gives the theme park an excuse to haul out images from Roman mythology, Viking lore, even the Druids. Frommers.com Community\n\nThe Prater, Vienna, Austria In the 1949 film The Third Man, set in a rubble-strewn post-World War II Vienna, Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten hold a clandestine meeting in the Prater, Emperor Josef II's old hunting ground and the official birthplace of the waltz. And where do Welles and Cotten talk where no one can overhear them? In one of the enclosed cars of the Riesenrad, the Prater's giant Ferris wheel, where they lift high over the rooftops of Vienna, warily gazing over the ravaged city below their feet.

Inventory is limited and demand is high, especially during the peak travel months of May to September.\n\nBut if you’re planning to vacation in what is known as \"the rail belt”—a wide swath of Southcentral Alaska that includes Denali National Park, Seward, Fairbanks, and Anchorage—you can take the train instead, thanks to passenger service available from the Alaska Railroad.\n\nThere are some serious perks to seeing the state by rail, starting with the relief that drivers will feel from not having to keep their eyes glued to a narrow, winding road. On the train, all you have to do is sit back and enjoy the scenery, some of which you can’t even access by car.\n\nThe 10-day itinerary we’ve put together below involves some fairly long-distance train rides on the Alaska Railroad. You won't have to deal with any quick, commuter-style transfers, but the cost of train tickets does add up pretty quickly. That makes this kind of trip best for singles, couples, and small families with some money to burn—if you’re looking to save money, you’ll probably find that accessing the stops along the route we’ve mapped will be cheaper if you rent a car or bring your own vehicle.\n\nIf you don't have a full 10 days to spend in Alaska, you can easily split this itinerary into two parts: The first runs from day 1 through day 4 and includes Anchorage and Seward; the second part is day 5 through day 10 and includes Anchorage, Talkeetna, Denali National Park, and Fairbanks.\n\nTo book train tickets, find travel packages, and get additional information, go to AlaskaRailroad.com.",

Friday, Aug. 23, is National Cheap Flight Day. This sacred event, which has been unofficially marked since 2015, commemorates the glorious season when airfare prices usually dip as summer begins to wrap up and, praise be, savings on plane tickets can occasionally be found after months of higher prices. Unfortunately, cheap flight season takes up only a little space on the calendar. After it's over, airfares steadily rise as the end-of-year holidays approach, reaching a peak around Thanksgiving. Unlike with other holiday-related phenomena (looking at you, Easter Bunny), you don't have to take the temporary decline in airfare prices on faith. Hard data from online travel agency CheapOair, a website that gets hyped up enough about the day to put out advance press releases, shows that since June 1, the average cost of a U.S. domestic airline ticket has decreased by 33.4%, while the price of tickets for international flights has dropped by 10%. What's more, those trends are expected to continue through August and September, according to CheapOair's analysis—suggesting the holiday isn't really a National Cheap Flight Day but a National Cheap Flight Month. “Summer is winding down and consumer focus is on returning to normal work and school schedules,\" explains Glenn Cusano, president of CheapOair parent corporation Fareportal, in a statement.",

For the last few years, the current decision makers at Disney have been carrying on as if they're running a shopping mall and not a national treasure. Obsessed with floating other divisions of the Walt Disney Company instead of tending to the fragile creative ecosystem that makes Disney so eternally beloved, the Disney parks have been forcing out long-serving staff members and their institutional knowledge, bleeding devoted customers with skyrocketing prices and fees, renovating heritage properties with dull contemporary trends, shutting down entire parks for months at a time, neglecting maintenance, and constructing new resorts that feel like cookie-cutter corporate chains rather than the thematic fantasias that earned Disney its position as a vacation champion.

Now Momondo is back on top, perhaps because of something to do with its merger with corporate cousin Kayak. (You now get exactly the same results from both Kayak and Momondo, but since Kayak leads its list with a “sponsored result” ad and Momondo’s design is easier on the eyes, Momondo gets top billing.) Momondo secured the best price a whopping six times, the second-best four times, and only dipped below average rates twice. Beyond price, Momondo has by far the most complete set of filters in the business, including a “Booking sites” list so you can weed out the results from shady OTAs, and it offers 13 ways to sort the results (compared to 3–8 elsewhere). You can even select or exclude aircraft types. The one filter that sets Momondo apart is the ability to select how many carry-on and checked bags you will bring so it can fold those fees into the price quotes. Only Kiwi and Google, way down at # 7 and #10 respectively, give you the same option, but the base airfares on those aren’t as low as they are on Momondo. Momondo has transitioned from pure aggregator (matchmaking customers with travel sellers) to include its own OTA selling its own tickets. It’s transparent about that, and you have to turn on this direct booking option in the filters sidebar.",

How to win an invitation to their little-known subculture\n\nIf you’re the kind of cruise passenger who loves finding generous discounts, you might want to take a moment before reading this next sentence. You’ve almost certainly sailed alongside passengers who have been invited to sail for free, lured onboard simply because they tend to visit casinos. Cruise lines are notoriously tight-lipped about precisely what might prompt them to extend passengers an offer for a free cruise (port fees and taxes still must be paid), but it’s happening. How to get a free cruise by gambling\n\n“It’s 100 percent about the spend. These free trips are offered to people the cruise lines see spending money in the casino,” says cruise expert Gary Bembridge, who founded the Tips for Travellers blog and has more than 443,000 subscribers for his YouTube channel. Bembridge regularly comes across passengers who’ve received this type of invitation. “On my last Holland America cruise, there was a group of 180 players who’d been invited on the sailing by the cruise line,” he says. Almost every cruise line with onboard casinos already runs a loyalty program that could translate into future invitations. For example, in Royal Caribbean’s Club Royale scheme, passengers earn one point for every $5 spent on slot machines and every $10 spent on video poker machines, and the line offers perks, including complimentary future cruises, for gamblers who reach 100,000 points.",

About ten years ago, airline greed reached a new low when every carrier in the nation refused to waive seating fees for families with young children to sit together inflight. I was at the center of the fight against it for a decade. At times, it seemed common sense and common decency would never win. But thankfully, the worst junk fee of all will soon be eliminated. Last week, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) announced a rulemaking that would ban airlines from charging fees for parents and caregivers to sit with kids 13 and under. While the news was more than welcome, it was not unexpected: In May 2024, President Biden signed the FAA Reauthorization Act, whereby Congress specifically gave the DOT the power to force the airlines to stop the madness. And the fees are not chump change. As the DOT notes, they could add up to at least $200 round-trip for a family of four. For years, government didn’t act to seat families together\n\nIn the mid-2010s, I was an airline passenger advocate for Consumer Reports (CR) and received a letter from a parent whom a major airline had assigned a seat apart from her 4-year-old.

Rose perches on the makeshift raft to avoid drowning or freezing in the icy North Atlantic Ocean, as her love interest, Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), clings to the edge while submerged up to his neck in the frigid waters. Many, many viewers have expressed an opinion that the famous flotsam was big enough to accommodate both young lovers, thereby saving a never-dreamier DiCaprio from the watery depths. We refuse to relitigate the matter, preferring to let the issue of the Titanic door's suitability for two dwell among the eternal mysteries of moviedom, right up there with the question of why the car flies at the end of Grease. For the record, the MythBusters TV show concluded in 2012 that both Jack and Rose could have survived on the piece of wood. The movie's director, James Cameron, disagrees. You're free to subject the Titanic panel to your own scrutiny at the Titanic Museum Attraction, a repository of artifacts and replicas housed in a structure built to resemble the ship itself in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, the Great Smoky Mountains town best known as the home of Dolly Parton's Dollywood theme park.",

But the minute Southwest Airlines announced that, after some 50 years, the carrier will do away with its open seating system, the online reaction seemed to repeat a certain point that rings true. You might hear it said that open seating was the best thing about flying Southwest. The lack of assigned seating made it easier for families to sit together without paying too much more. All you had to do was check in 24 hours before departure and secure an early boarding group—it was all about jostling for that A group. I personally found the boarding experience anxiety-inducing and dehumanizing, but millions of customers have felt it made Southwest easier and more affordable to use. Now Southwest has announced it will begin charging for seating assignments, and will deviate from its long-running system of seat equality to add seats with extra legroom, which will also come with an extra charge. Let's be honest. Southwest's no-class system had already deteriorated before today, eroded by cash grabs. The airline's \"EarlyBird\" check-in upcharge, available 36 hours before departure for $15 a person, was already infuriating customers who bought it, thinking the service would allow them to seat their entire families together, yet still finding themselves in group B. \"What's up?\" Denver TV host Jeff Schroeder asked Southwest on the air on July 16. \"What am I paying for? ... I'm paying to be average?\" Now, just like the other airlines, Southwest will charge you to access higher-quality versions of the same service.",

Located in the desert town–turned–unlikely arts hub of Marfa (about 50 miles east of the Mexico border), the Blackwell School National Historic Site was formally established last week by the Biden administration, which has now designated a total of seven national park units since President Joe Biden took office. The Blackwell School's History: Segregation and Resilience\n\nThe Blackwell School National Historic Site comprises two buildings, including an original adobe structure that was erected in 1909 as an elementary school for the region's Mexican American children at a time when Texas schools were segregated by race. At so-called \"Mexican schools\" like this one, the Austin American-Statesman explains, teachers would forbid students of Mexican descent to speak their native language. In fact, first graders were instructed to \"bury Mr. Spanish\" in a mock funeral. Spanish speakers who slipped up could be punished with a wooden paddle, the newspaper reports. The Blackwell School remained open until 1965, when the Marfa Independent School District was finally integrated, according to the Associated Press. “Today’s designation of the Blackwell School as our nation’s newest national park ensures that the rich history and cultural heritage of this significant place is preserved for future generations,” said Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland in a statement. “This site is a powerful reminder of our nation’s diverse and often complex journey toward equality and justice. By honoring the legacy of Blackwell School, we recognize the resilience and contributions of the Latino community in our shared history.”\n\nThe effort to save and restore the school and to get it permanent federal protection was led by a group of former Blackwell students who formed a nonprofit known as the Blackwell School Alliance.",

Certain world events that we have all apparently agreed to rarely speak of delayed that debut voyage to October 2021, when the Scarlet Lady set sail for a series of departures packed with young influencer types who were invited to help the adults-only brand achieve liftoff as a bacchanalian boat with modern style. Virgin's reign as the up-all-night party cruise line seemed to last only as long as the weirdly named \"revenge travel\" trend. Once Covid-related pent-up demand began to subside, the average age of Virgin's passengers began to crawl upward, and the line redefined itself as a minimally intimidating cruise for all ages. To sustain itself for the long run, Virgin has had to pivot toward a broader market of \"young at heart\" customers, as Frommer's found when we took a Virgin Voyages cruise a few months ago. While the line's sailings remain adults-only, the brand is no longer exclusively the domain of selfie-snapping, midnight-boozing Gen Zers. We encountered a healthy mix of demographic groups going up to Gen X and into \"grandparenting age.\" But as the brand repositions itself in the market, Virgin still needs to fill berths, particularly in late summer when bookings can be softer due to concerns over hurricanes. That's why Virgin just announced a sale that's substantial enough for us to tell you about. For sailings in 2024, cruisers can book a Central Sea Terrace (or lower cabin category) for two on a Virgin Voyages ship and travel with a kid at no extra cost.",

Here’s how to navigate Paris even if you’re not attending the Summer Games. A century since it last hosted the games, Paris hosts the 2024 Summer Olympic Games from July 26 through August 11, with the Paralympics following from August 28 to September 8. After failing several times in recent decades to win the Games, Paris ultimately landed them by pitching an original twist. Instead of being confined to dedicated sporting venues, many events will be held at Paris’s most iconic sites, including archery at Les Invalides, skateboarding in Place de la Concorde, and beach volleyball beneath the Eiffel Tower. The River Seine will also feature prominently, first during the opening ceremonies, when 10,000 athletes are expected to sail on it aboard 170 boats, and later for some aquatic competitions. The Olympic Village and several new sport complexes will center around the Stade de France (pictured above), France’s national stadium on the edge of Paris in the suburb of Saint-Denis. In a spirit of sportsmanship, the city will also share events around the rest of France, including soccer in Nice to Nantes, sailing off the Marseille coastline, and surfing in French Polynesia, half the world away. What will remain open in Paris during the Olympics? Still recovering from lower visitor numbers during Covid, hospitality professionals are gearing up for a busy and profitable summer. Many businesses plan to forego their usual annual August vacation closures. “We plan on being open for the duration of the Games, which is likely the case for most restaurants in tourist districts or in the north of the city,” says Philippine Jaillet of Le Boréal, a restaurant behind the northern Paris neighborhood of Montmartre.",

As we all know, Rome wasn’t built in a day. But as any recent visitor can attest, it sure looks like the city is being rebuilt—all day, every day. There are a staggering 3,200 public construction projects currently underway across the Eternal City, including many in and around some of the most popular tourist attractions. For visitors keen on getting unobstructed, scaffolding-free views of, among other sites, the Pantheon, the Fountain of the Four Rivers, or the Colosseum, here’s a hard truth: 2024 might not be your year. Why is there so much construction in Rome right now? The reason so much of Rome is walled off or under scaffolding this year is due to what’s happening next year: the Vatican's Jubilee of 2025. The yearlong event, which kicks off on December 24, 2024, is billed by the Catholic Church as “a special year of grace,” where the faithful have the chance to obtain a plenary indulgence, or washing away of sins as if the believer were freshly baptized anew. Jubilees take place every 25 years, and are marked by the opening of the otherwise closed Holy Doors of Rome’s four papal basilicas: St. Peter’s Basilica, the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran, Santa Maria Maggiore, and St. Paul Outside the Walls. For their souls to be cleansed, pilgrims are invited to pass through these doors, perform acts of mercy or penances, or pray at one of several other churches in Rome.",

A new furor is unfolding in the skies as airlines are caught drastically reducing the maximum permitted size of carry-on bags on commercial flights. Unnoticed by many casual travelers, the volume of an allowed carry-on bag on some popular airlines has been cut as much as 55% since 2018, the BBC reports. The worst offender so far, according to the BBC, is the Ireland-based no-frills carrier Ryanair, which slashed allowed proportions from 55 x 40 x 20cm (21.6 x 15.7 x 7.8 inches) in 2018 to just 40 x 20 x 25cm (15.7 x 7.8 x 9.8 inches) in 2024. To give you a sense of how small that is, a men's size 9 shoe in the U.S. measures about 27 cm—which is too long for what the airline now allows. Other airlines caught quietly slashing size limits include easyJet and Wizz Air, two more popular carriers for affordable European flights. The reduced capacity has turned previously acceptable pieces of luggage into cash cows for the airlines. Passengers who have used the same luggage for years are arriving at the airport to discover their bags are no longer acceptable without added fees. \"The reduced allowances mean many common carry-on bags that would have been fine just a few years ago are now too large to bring on board without paying extra fees,\" Emma Coulthurst of the vacation price comparison site TravelSupermarket told journalists covering the story in the United Kingdom. Consumer watchdogs estimate that airlines like Ryanair make around 30% of their revenue from added fees, which isn't unusual in the aviation industry.",

Learn why before you book a Disney cruise. By the end of 2024, Disney Cruise Line (DCL) will have six ships in operation, with two more in the pipeline. That's double the fleet the company had 12 years ago, when a single private island, Castaway Cay, could handle all the ships that needed to call there on Caribbean sailings. All the major cruise lines now maintain at least one privately managed beach destination in the Caribbean that is used as a port of call to keep a day's worth of tourist spending safely inside the company. In 2018, our founder, Arthur Frommer, called cruise line private islands \"extortion on a cruise whose price I have already paid,\" but that hasn't abated their rise or popularity, since they give cruisers a resort-like environment to enjoy without worrying about currency conversions or crime rates. This year, Disney added a second bespoke destination to increase its capacity for Caribbean cruises. In June, the company opened Disney Lookout Cay at Lighthouse Point, an enclave on the island of Eleuthera in the Bahamas. Immediately, travelers began complaining about nakedly exposed walkways, swarms of flies, and a grueling layout that required visitors to slog down a marathon pier before they could even get to land. \"This adventure required a half-mile walk on a pier under the blazing Bahamas sun, followed by waiting with a crowd to ride a 10-minute tram to reach the main area of the park,\" wrote Travel Weekly, an industry publication that's not prone to hyperbole.",

Paris' miserable Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG) is a bane of world travel, particularly for flight transfers. A dysfunctional layout, awkward connections, lousy signage, alienating Brutalist architecture, and crowds of grumpy international travelers who don't speak your language—the airport may be the perfect embodiment of the pompous politico it's named for. The French countryside may be calming and lovely, but you'll have to pay a heavy toll to see it if you arrive at CDG. Nonetheless, CDG has been unavoidable for many North American travelers because so many transatlantic airlines use it. Plus, the aiport has the easiest ground transportation links to Paris (about an hour). At least, that used to be true. Another airport in Paris just became much cheaper and faster to reach than Charles de Gaulle. On June 24, 3 years ahead of its originally announced opening date, Line 14 of the Paris Métro subway system christened a new extension that stops directly at Paris-Orly Airport. Now automated Métro trains depart from a new Orly station every 3–5 minutes and take just 30 minutes to reach the Pyramides stop in the middle of Paris. Unlike the previously existing rail option at Orly, it's a one-seat journey from airport to town, and the fare is typically just €10.30 (US$11.23). Before \"Ligne 14\" expanded, getting ground transportation from Orly required road vehicles or the cumbersome OrlyVal shuttle/train combination (pictured below; €14.10 or $15.37) that could take an hour or longer—and is now much slower and more expensive than the new Métro option.",

The Sphere, a giant illuminated dome that was recently built next to The Venetian Resort, is the new shining star of Las Vegas, adding a brilliant orb of flashing lights to the colorful skyline of The Strip. The Sphere (255 Sands Ave.), simply called Sphere by the people who run it, opened in the summer of 2023 at a reported cost of $2.3 billion and became an instant landmark. Its exterior is covered with 1.2 million multi-color LED lights that are programmed to create ever-changing, awe-inspiring displays. Abstract art, trompe l’oeil, and occasional advertising campaigns swirl across the surface, with the brightest images lighting up around sunset and usually culminating in a recreation of the moon by late night. The effect is both exhilarating and hypnotic, like the world’s most intense screen saver, but one with a sense of humor. But the interior of Sphere is a tourist draw of its own: a massive event venue of up to 17,000 seats across nine levels for concerts and movies. It's being promoted as “the most technologically advanced performance space in the city” based on features including a wraparound LED screen at 16K, the highest resolution in the world at a scale like this, and mechanisms to create \"4-D\" immersive shows using enhanced sound, wind, and aromas.

In the late 1920s, the Empire State Building, 40 Wall Street, and the Chrysler Building were all being constructed in Manhattan. Architects for each of the three buildings were desperate to claim the title of the world's tallest skyscraper. The Chrysler and 40 Wall each added some new levels to ensure they'd be the one to claim the crown, but then the Chrysler surprised everyone by installing its gleaming sculptural steel ornament as a topper, winning the race to the sky. But when the construction of the Empire State Building wrapped up just 12 months later, competitors were horrified to see that designers had added a zeppelin mast to the top of the newest structure, qualifying it as the height champ. Despite the Chrysler's temporary victory, the Empire State Building was the tallest building in the world for 40 years. Something similar is afoot in Orlando, Florida.

For the last few months, ocean researchers have been tracking a huge blob of the stuff floating in the Atlantic Ocean and headed westward in time to ruin summer vacation photos in places like Cancún, the Dominican Republic, and South Florida. In addition to marring a beach's appearance, the macroalgae is expensive to remove and tends to smell like rotten eggs when it starts decomposing on shore. That's because as it rots it produces hydrogen sulfide gas, the Florida Department of Health explains, potentially irritating the eyes, nose, and throat when inhaled, especially if you have asthma or other breathing issues. Touching sargassum itself doesn't cause skin problems such as stinging or rashes, experts say, though tiny organisms living in the seaweed might.

Beaches Without Sargassum in 2024\n\nBased on an analysis of satellite images and oceanographic conditions, hydrobiologist Esteban Amaro of Mexico's Sargassum Monitoring Network is projecting that the Mexican Caribbean—which includes Cancún and Riviera Maya resort towns such as Playa del Carmen and Tulum—will remain virtually sargassum-free from now to September, and possibly through the rest of the year.

Going by the number of lifeguard rescues, the biggest hazard at the beach—by far—is encountering a rip current. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), rip currents prompt more than 80% of rescues at surf beaches (i.e., any coastal areas where waves break). Powerful channels of water that can rapidly pull swimmers away from the shore and out to sea, rip currents also account for over 100 drownings each year in the U.S., according to the United States Lifesaving Association. And in recent years, that number has been ticking upward, per government data. News reports of multiple drownings and scores of beach rescues within the span of a single week are not uncommon. Experts cite several reasons for the heightened risk—everything from a shortage of lifeguards (particularly on Florida's Gulf Coast) paired with higher numbers of beachgoers, to more intense storms and climate change (though NOAA is still looking into whether there's a connection between rip currents and warming waters, agency officials told USA Today). Anyone planning to swim while at the beach should know about rip currents—how to spot them, how dangerous it can be to disregard posted warnings, and how to escape should you suddenly find yourself subject to the mighty pull of the sea. What are rip currents and why are they so dangerous? As the National Weather Service explains, rip currents are channels of water that flow from near the shore to past the point where waves break.",

Questionable Air Travel Hack #1: Wear Red to Get Better Treatment\n\n(An authoritative and appealing experienced traveler in red | Credit: Delta News Hub)\n\nThe hack: According to some psychological studies, people wearing red are perceived to be more authoritative and even more attractive (a result of the so-called “red dress effect”) than the beige-clad masses. Armchair color theorists (amplified by media enablers) therefore advise flyers to wear shades of red when traveling so that airport security agents, airline workers, and flight crews will subconsciously regard those scarlet-sporting passengers as important, desirable, and deserving of a seamless TSA experience and maybe an upgrade to business class.",

        "text": "Many travelers won't know or remember this, but there was a time when airline passengers had to to present a claim check in order to pick up their luggage after flights. Until the early 1980s, it was standard for passengers to be asked by a security representative in the baggage claim area to match the code number on their checked-bag receipt to prove their checked bags belonged to them. In those days, the claim check was often the perforated stub of the luggage tag. That way, the airlines knew that each piece of luggage went home with the person who checked it. It's past time for some simple luggage security to return to baggage claim. Just look at some recent headlines, which reveal a consistent and global problem with the major airlines' safe custody of our baggage. * As the Los Angeles Times reported on Wednesday, A woman's luggage didn't make it on to her recent American Airlines flight to Burbank, California. After five days with no news, American finally told her it found the bag and would take care of the issue—but then it delivered the wrong bag to her. So the passenger tracked her stuff down with an Apple AirTag. The passenger told KTLA, a local TV station, that she went to the location of the AirTag to check things out. \"That day I saw dozens of suitcases, brand new suitcases, name-brand suitcases strewn across Western and Sunset,” she said. “Rows and rows of suitcases, bicycles, baby strollers with airline tags on them everywhere.”\n\nHow do \"dozens\" of suitcases move undetected from an airport baggage claim 10 miles away, even traveling around a mountain range that's in between?",

A new report from the European Commission and the European Environment Agency found that 85% of the \"bathing waters\" across Europe are of \"excellent quality.\" And the situation is even better when you exclude inland waters such as lakes and rivers, with 89% of European coastal bathing sites classified as \"excellent\" in the cleanliness department. Researchers tested sites across 27 European Union countries, plus Albania and Switzerland. In accordance with Europe's Bathing Water Directive, the continent's coastlines, lakes, and other waterways are regularly tested for pollutants and bacteria that can make people sick, with monitors rating water quality as excellent, good, sufficient, or poor. The latest report is based on 2023 data. Four European countries earned an excellent rating for 95% or more of waters tested there: Cyprus (97.6%), Austria (96.9%), Croatia (96.7%), and Greece (95.8%). Bulgaria (94.8%) just missed the 95% mark. But if you focus only on places bordering oceans and seas, Croatia jumps into the top spot, with a remarkable 99.1% of the country's beaches (886 out of 894 sites tested) determined to have excellent water quality.

The good news: A new digital renewal process is on the way, and you can sign up now. Although the event didn't get a lot of attention at the time, in December 2021 President Joe Biden signed a new executive order that will allow Americans to renew their passports online in a matter of days (see Sec. 4 of the official text). That development is a big deal for regular travelers because until now, when a passport reached the end of its validity, citizens had to mail the old booklet to the government and wait weeks or months for a renewal. Many countries require a passport to be valid for at least six months past your visit dates, so waiting until you have six months or fewer left will make it impossible to visit some destinations. But if you start your renewal at the one-year mark, which is the earliest the State Department will allow you to begin renewal, you'll ensure that you'll get your new booklet with enough time and space to keep it valid for most places. Think of an adult U.S. passport as being good for nine years, not 10, because that final year before expiration is fraught with validity exceptions, and renewals are currently prone to delays. Based on this timeline, we recommend that you begin your passport renewal process when your existing document has one year to nine months left on its validity. Any later than that, and you risk not receiving your new passport in time to visit a country with a six-month validity rule.",

Carl Shepherd was the co-founder of the major vacation rental platform HomeAway, which is now part of the behemoth known as VRBO. But that doesn't mean he feels any loyalty to his former company. At a recent industry gathering (the Skift Short Term Rental Summit), Shepherd revealed from the stage that when plans his own vacations, he sidesteps the big booking platforms he helped create. \"I’ve pretty much quit using both VRBO and Airbnb personally,\" he said. \"I found it humbling. I don’t because I’m not going to pay that fee. I’m just going to book directly with the property manager.\" Generally, I don't turn to CEOs for travel hacks—they’re more focused on shoring up the bottom line for their businesses than saving customers money. But I gotta say this one caught my interest. I decided to look into just how much money one could save by avoiding VRBO and Airbnb, and then figure out how easy it is to simply contact a home's property manager directly, as Shepherd does instead. Short answers: You'll save a significant amount on vacation rentals. Here's how to do it. Airbnb and VRBO are still the best places to locate details about the vast majority of vacation rentals on the planet.So use them for research purposes. But when you find a rental you like, scroll down to information about the \"hosts\" who oversee the property.If the host is an individual, you may be out of luck if you want to reach out to them directly.",

How will that work? Let's say United knows that you regularly fly to Chicago. That might mean on every other flight you take, the ads shown before your inflight movie—or perhaps interrupting the middle of it—could be for games at Wrigley Field, and Windy City hotels. Meanwhile, the person sitting next to you could be getting ads mostly for London, or perhaps for vegetarian products, if the data mined from that person's meal selections with the airline suggested they'd be in the market for those.

I just took an Azores Airlines flight to and from its hub destination, the island of São Miguel in the Azores archipelago, located off the coast of Portugal. I have some strong feelings about the airline's service. Should you book a flight with the carrier? We'll get to that, but first some background about the company:\n\nThough SATA Azores Airlines is among the least expensive transatlantic carriers, it is no upstart. It has been in business since 1990, first under the name OceanAir, then SATA Air Açores. The current name has been on the letterhead since 2020. The airline operates year-round flights from Boston, New York City, and Toronto to its home base in the Azores capital, Ponta Delgada. Many flights then continue on to Porto on Portugal's mainland and to the island of Madeira. In the summer months, Azores Airlines operates direct flights from the U.S. to those latter two destinations and, this summer, to the Italian city of Milan with a stop in Ponta Delgada on the way. The stopover program allows passengers to get off the plane and spend 7 days in the Azores before continuing on to Madeira or the European mainland without having to buy another ticket. The airline's prices are often, though not always, the lowest available. Looking at fares for this summer between New York City and Porto, I found that the carrier was usually $200 to $400 cheaper than Portugal’s national airline, TAP Air Portugal, but on par with what Delta Air Lines and Air France were charging for the same route—although the competitions' flights included a stop in Paris, rather than a nonstop flight.",

But the association has worked out just fine for Martha’s Vineyard, the Massachusetts island that played Amity in the wildly successful 1975 film adaptation of Peter Benchley’s bestselling novel. In return for supplying the thriller’s scenic seaside setting, the island received a tourism boom with an impact lasting into the present day, nearly five decades after Jaws smashed box office records, becoming the prototypical summer blockbuster, redefining Hollywood’s business model, and sparking Lord-only-knows-how-many freakouts in the minds of ocean swimmers who felt seaweed brushing against a leg and thought they were about to become fish food. Thanks to what the Martha’s Vineyard Chamber of Commerce calls “the Jaws Effect,” the island became a “set-jetting” destination before that was a thing. Because the movie was filmed almost entirely on location, fans quickly figured out there was an easy way to feel like they were visiting the picturesque set of their favorite movie. Of course, a lot of water has passed under the American Legion Memorial aka Jaws Bridge since the film’s famously fraught location shoot in 1974. But visitors to Martha’s Vineyard will discover much on the island remains recognizable from what they have seen onscreen (the parts they could bear to watch, anyway). Even if you’re not a Jaws obsessive, the following self-guided driving tour of filming locations from Jaws will give you a nice overview of Martha's Vineyard.",

Yet even in this age of busy rental platforms like Airbnb, 65% of them are never listed on the major rental sites, mostly because their owners would rather not rent to strangers. But that could soon change for some of them thanks to a new website that makes renting a home feel safer. Brent Hieggelke, one of the founders of Trustr, told me that most second homes are viewed more as personal investments than rental properties, so they sit empty 10 to 11 months a year. \"Many second home owners would be open to sharing or renting them, but only to people that they know and trust,\" said Hieggelke. \"Trustr is the first platform built for these owners, allowing them to create a listing visible only to their curated guest list. It provides the peace of mind they need to share and rent their property.”\n\nTo that end, Trustr, which debuts June 5, works on several access tiers. At the first tier (called Private Listing—Free Edition), home owners can create a rental listing for their second home for free and send its URL to up to 10 friends and family members. That will be the limit of their access of the Trustr site, though. The next level up (Private Listing—Unlimited) allows the renter to send out as many links as they want. At this level, Trustr will also feature semi-private listings, which allow renters to post a summary of their home either to their direct social network (friends), or to a more extended network (friends and friends of friends).",

The deadline for all Americans to be using Real I.D., the strengthened identification format that was announced in 2005 during the George W. Bush administration after the security disasters of September 11, 2001, has been affirmed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Americans must not really need safer identification at airports and federal buildings that badly, because the repeated delay of Real ID's eternally approaching deadline has become one of the most reliable running jokes in travel. Previously announced \"deadlines\" for either states or travelers to comply have included December 31, 2009; May 11, 2011; January 15, 2013; October 1, 2021; and September 30, 2021. In December 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) pushed the deadline from May 3, 2023, to May 7, 2025. In a statement explaining the umpteenth easement, DHS wrote, \"progress over the past two years has been significantly hindered by state driver’s licensing agencies having to work through the backlogs created by the pandemic.\" And less than a year before the final implementation of Real I.D., that date appears to be sticking. If this new date for Real ID compliance holds, babies who were born when Real I.D. was originally imagined will be old enough to be traveling with babies of their own by the time it's finally in place. We'll have gotten a whole new Star Wars trilogy, two new Avatar movies, and two new Indiana Jones sequels in the time it's taken.

Bag a shoulder season deal\n\nIn travel, shoulder season is the period between peak season and low season, and you’ll find it in cruising, too. Cruise lines don’t only offer consistently lower prices during shoulder season sailings—they’ll typically offer regular flash sales during these times, too. “Keep an eye out for flash sales during shoulder seasons,” says Elaine Warren, founder of specialist cruise travel agency FamilyCruiseCompanion.com. “Cruise lines are desperate to fill ships during these times. I've found some real steals by being ready to book as soon as I see a great offer pop up.”\n\nBear in mind that different regions have different shoulder seasons. In Alaska, for example, the main shoulder seasons are April and early May, and then at the end of summer between September and mid-October. Europe’s shoulder seasons are April and May, and then again in September to November. For Caribbean cruises, it’s May, June, and July and then in December, January, and March. Try to book at least six months in advance\n\nPassionate cruisers Don and Heidi Bucolo, founders of top cruise blog EatSleepCruise.com, say that advance booking can be a key to great deals. “Our advice is to book cruises between 6 and 12 months in advance. Typically, cruise prices tend to go up closer to the sail date, especially for newer ships or for more desirable travel dates.”\n\nConsider repositioning cruises\n\nRepositioning cruises are one-way sailings during which ships relocate from one region to another, like when they switch between summer Europe sailings to a winter Caribbean schedule.",

They're lower than normal because of the lingering misperception that this sunny region, which is located just north of the fire-struck town of Lahaina, either doesn't want tourism or can't host it yet. But those perceptions are not true. Those who viewed the unforgettable images of Lahaina's fire-ravaged Front Street in August 2023 should be aware that key attractions on the town's northern end have all recently reopened, including Aloha Mixed Plate and Mala Ocean Tavern restaurants, Old Lahaina Luau, Lahaina Cannery Mall (home to the Lahaina Plantation Museum and a weekly arts and crafts fair), and Maui Ku‘ia Estate Chocolate Factory (which has cacao farm tour, tastings, and a weekly benefit for Maui fire relief.)

At least 9 of the coolest, most-visited reserves across the country (we list them here) now require would-be visitors to make advance reservations to access all or part of the parks. It's not as if the National Park Service is making it simple. Each park sets its own rules about when advance bookings open. For example, Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado begins taking bookings a month in advance for the following month from late May to late October. Meanwhile, Arches National Park in Utah (pictured above) opts for the Taylor Swift-via-Ticketmaster, mistake-waiting-to-happen pig-pile of opening reservations on the first day of the month that falls three months ahead of dates between April and October. And even then, you'll have to pay another $2 to secure the reservation, which is on top of the usual entry charge. It's hard to keep it all straight, and harder still to plan so far ahead every time. So if you fail to obtain a reservation for the day you want to go, you're forgiven. It can all be so bewildering.

Getting into airline lounges can make or break the comfort of your travel experience, especially when you're about to embark on a long flight. But the Shangri-La behind the magic sliding doors of the VIP zone doesn’t have to be reserved for those in the most expensive seats on the plane. You can still tuck into restaurant-style meals and a bottomless cocktail menu before you have to squeeze in with the other sardines on the plane. Here’s how. Buy a lounge membership\n\nLounge access comes in many forms. The most straightforward way to visit an airline lounge (at least in the U.S., Canada, and Australia) is by paying for lounge membership. Depending on the airline, that can cost between around $500 and $1,495 (Delta Air Line’s ambitiously exorbitant new cost for an executive membership permits two guests). Sums like that only makes sense for the most frequent of flyers with a particular airline. Earn elite status\n\nAnother way to gain access to the lounge on international trips is by holding a certain type of loyalty status with an airline or its affiliated partners or alliance. For example, a Delta flyer with SkyTeam Elite Plus status would be able to access a KLM lounge when traveling through Amsterdam, no matter what cabin their ticket is for. American Airlines' top-tier elite members holding Oneworld Emerald and Sapphire status would have similar lounge access in many airports when flying internationally. That's one of the main benefits of status, and there have been so many qualified passengers that it's no longer uncommon to find long lines at airport lounges, which have become so popular that many have wait lists to get in, even for just a few minutes of rest before takeoff.",

Mild winters and wet summers, like the ones experienced in many parts of the United States in recent years, tend to boost populations of the eight-legged bloodsuckers, experts told the Associated Press, and the tiny parasites have expanded their geographic range as well. Species once confined to New England and the Midwest have spread into the South and the Great Plains, while southern varietals have crept northward. A bite from one of the most common species, blacklegged ticks (aka deer ticks), can cause Lyme disease, an infection with symptoms such as a bull's-eye rash, fever, headache, and fatigue. The illness should be treated with antibiotics to avoid more serious neurological issues and heart problems. According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, Lyme disease is most commonly transmitted by ticks in the Northeast, upper Midwest, and northwestern states, but cases have been reported \"in nearly all states in the U.S. and in large areas in Europe and Asia.\" Lyme isn't the only tickborne disease out there, either.

A single selfish tourist taking a small vial of sand would barely seem to matter. Indeed, some previous generations of travelers grew up thinking there's no harm in snatching small amounts of beaches for sentiment's sake. But if everyone did that, eventually the damage would mount. Just as the unthinkably massive herds of American buffalo were gradually hunted to the brink of extinction, many of the world's beaches are under assault by extreme weather, dwindling local maintenance budgets, theft for industrial purposes (there's a black market for sand), and hordes of self-centered visitors. Destinations around the world are getting serious about banning the practice of taking sand, and many of them are backing up the rules with stiff fines and even the threat of prison time. You might think that beaches are simply deposits of naturally replenishing sand. But you'd be wrong. A not-insignificant number of popular beaches have in fact been engineered to look and feel the way they do. Even in Florida, which is world-famous for its shores, the natural substance lining significant sections of the coast is actually a boggy gray mud more suited to growing mangrove trees than to playing beach blanket bingo. In many popular tourist areas, the sugary powder we know and love is often the product of intentional civic engineering. Just this year, Fort Lauderdale spent $40 million and called in the Army Corps of Engineers to replenish its dwindling supply; in 2018, the price for new sand was $50 million.",

No matter how they’re eaten—plain, dipped in coffee, slathered with jam or chocolate spread, stuffed with ham and melted cheese—croissants are an integral part of a French breakfast (or afternoon snack). You’ll know a croissant has been made the right way when it has a flaky outer case; light, buttery, yet squidgy innards; and the power to make your heart sing. The pastry is always made using either butter (croissants au beurre) or margarine (croissants ordinaires, which have a more breadlike texture). As you meander the quaint sidewalks of Paris, you’ll also notice bakeries selling variations like croissant aux amandes (topped with almond cream and sliced almonds), rectangular pain au chocolat (the same dough but filled with dark chocolate), and swirl-shaped pain aux raisins (layered with custard and raisins). More recent innovations have capitalized on a craze for fusion pastries such as the cronut (croissant + donut) and the cruffin (croissant + muffin). Then, of course, there’s the crookie, a hybrid combining a croissant with cookie dough that became a TikTok phenomenon in early 2024 at Maison Louvard (11 rue de Châteaudun, 9th arrond.). For the record, I found the crookie to be far too sweet. My 7-year-old, on the other hand, devoured the thing in 5 seconds flat. Chacun à son goût. (Crookies at Maison Louvard in Paris | Credit: Anna E. Brooke)\n\nUpstarts notwithstanding, the classic croissant still reigns supreme in Paris.",

Most summers, Orlando's theme parks construct a new blockbuster ride or two to attract families anew. But 2024 is different. A year from now, Orlando will open its first new theme park in 26 years, Universal Epic Universe. Construction crews are already testing rides at what is shaping up to be the most elaborate and cutting-edge theme park the United States has seen in decades. Ahead of that huge debut, Orlando is putting on a milder party than usual in 2024. You'll be hearing lots of hype about Orlando in the coming weeks through the usual advertising channels and on social media, but the truth is that this year's changes can best be described as rearranging the furniture. Pretty much every major new thing to do in Orlando is a reworking of an older attraction that needed fixing. • On June 28, Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom officially opens Tiana's Bayou Adventure, a top-to-bottom re-skinning of the popular but culturally problematic Splash Mountain water flume ride. The attraction will now center on the characters from the 2009 animated film The Princess and the Frog. Disney crews shut down the old ride in January 2023 to redecorate, rip out dozens of Audio-Animatronic robots, and install a much smaller number of more advanced replacements, like Tiana (pictured above). Until the ride begins hosting preview guests, the jury is out on whether the finished product will reflect the penny-pinching and quality drift typical of latter-day Disney executives, or whether the company's recent leadership woes and mass layoffs of creative teams have brought Disney's creative powers back to form.",

Renting a car in Europe is subject to a slightly different set of default rules than renting in the U.S., so Americans have to be more alert during the rental process. This advice, which comes from experts at the American Automobile Association, SIXT car rental company, and recent experience, can smooth the road. • Be sure your driver’s license is valid in the countries where you plan to drive. While few countries actually require an International Driving Permit (IDP), many (including Spain, France, Hungary, and Italy) require official translations of your local license. An IDP is accepted in lieu of a language-specific translation, according to the U.S. State Department, provided you also have your state-issued driver’s license on hand. An IDP costs $20, is valid for a year, and can be obtained at most AAA offices (find one at www.aaa.com). You will need two passport-size photos, your driver’s license, and the signed application form, available for download here. You can also get one by mail, but AAA recommends calling ahead to verify that your local office handles driving permits. • Age matters. Some rental companies—and even some countries—have minimum and maximum age requirements or charge extra for drivers over a certain age. For instance, only drivers 21 and older can rent in Ireland and England, and vacationers under 25 will pay a surcharge in Spain.",

We've got the classics, like witches, vampires, and werewolves, plus plenty of others, like merfolk, fae, ghosts, zombies, necromancers, and so much more. These supernatural romance books bring a touch of magic to the romance world, and they're just a little bit different from a few similar genres.\n\nThe closest comparison would probably be fantasy romance, or \"romantasy,\" which usually brings in elements of the fantasy genre (epic scale, significant world-building, a complex system of magic) and layers those with a significant romance plot thread. For many readers, the line between these books and paranormal romance books for adults is somewhat blurry, but in most cases, the \"paranormal\" label indicates that you'll get a heavier focus on the supernatural beings — the vampires, the shifters, and so on — and on the romance, rather than the full-fledged fantasy world-building.\n\nNo matter your tastes, there's definitely a good paranormal romance book out there for you! Some authors prefer to put a rom-com twist on the genre, like Lana Harper or April Asher. Others, like Nalini Singh or Kresley Cole, are mainstays of the genre for their sprawling, long-running series filled with all sorts of sexy supernaturals. Whether you take your paranormal romance with a side of chills or a side of laughs, check out these books to add some magic to your reading.",

As I did, an even stranger feeling came over me, a lack of recognition of my own voice. You see, I've been code-switching so long that sometimes I'm unsure where the real me begins. Obviously, this was my friend, so I was being genuine in my language. However, as someone who has been a professional for many years, as well as an academic, the voice that I heard on playback was just one of many.

That's why it's refreshing to see that recently many Latine celebs have been more candid about the pressure they've felt to code-switch or \"talk white\" and are openly rejecting the practice to embrace their authentic selves. This is no doubt due to the current selling power Latines are enjoying on a global level.

This month, we spoke with Colombian rising star Elsa y Elmar about dealing with burnout, safeguarding her mental health, and how all this impacted the process of creating her latest album, \"PALACIO.\" Elsa Margarita Carvajal is no stranger to success. Better known by her stage name, Elsa y Elmar, the Latin Grammy-nominated singer has been making waves in the music scene for more than a decade. But with her latest album \"PALACIO\" releasing on August 30th, and on the brink of hitting the road for her biggest tour yet, Carvajal is poised to reach a whole new level. To reach that level once meant putting in many years on the indie circuit and playing solo in bars trying to connect to people who had never heard of her. And even though her unknown indie artist days are behind her, the singer admits that the pressure remains. Carvajal says that pressure can be both good and bad. On the one hand it can push artists to achieve bigger and better things, reaching the levels previously reached by their idols. But on the other hand, the constant pressure to push for more and compare oneself to their peers or those who came before can be detrimental from a mental health perspective. The songstress says that she sometimes found herself in a constant state of work, thinking about what more she can do. This led her to take a much needed break to recharge after her last album \"Ya No Somos Los Mismos.\"",

I believe that one of my purposes in this life is to bring people together in a way that transcends status, class, and occupation, creating a space where everyone feels truly united and understood. That's why in 2022, I decided to launch my first El Teteo party in Los Angeles, driven by a longing for something that reminded me of my home in NYC. I was feeling homesick and needed to feel connected to my roots and my community. El Teteo serves as an extension of what I was taught: to find moments of joy through pain, troubles, and hard work. For me, community is about gathering with the people you love and care for, no matter where you are — whether that's getting together with beach chairs in front of a building or plastic chairs at a park under a bridge. Teteo, which is a Dominican slang word for partying and gathering anywhere, suggests that when it comes to community, all you need is good music, good company, and some beers — and, in some cases, food. It's all about sharing moments that aren't guaranteed tomorrow, and it's something that's very much embedded in Latine culture. As a New Yorker, I found myself missing my city and its vibrant club scenes and dance parties. At almost every party and club I'd been to in Los Angeles, people stood around with a drink in hand instead of getting on the dance floor. Through El Teteo, I wanted to bring the East Coast vibe to the West Coast, raise awareness about Latine Caribbean culture, and foster community.",

On July 18th, Moffa's debut album finally made its debut. Titled \"Playground,\" the project reflects his unbridled enthusiasm and curiosity. As he puts it: \"Even as an adult, I still feel like a child in lots of ways,\" which in part inspired the LP's name.

Her role in \"White Men Can't Jump\" was originally intended for an Italian or Irish American actress, but she eventually proved she was the perfect fit for the role. \"I'm always looking for characters because there's not much that I can play with this stupid accent,\" she told the Los Angeles Times earlier this year. \"I can't play a scientist or be in 'Schindler's List.'

They are so special that they've been immortalized in great works of literature, cinema, and songs for decades now. Perhaps most famously on the Latine side of things, El Gran Combo's \"Un Verano En Nueva York\" stands as an ode to New York City summer and everything it brings with it: street festivals, block parties, boat tours, beach days. And for many Latines in the city, summertime marks the return of a time-honored tradition: Latin dance nights. As a kid, my father had my sister and me on the weekends, and he would take us down to South Street Seaport for salsa night. This was before the recent renovation, back when the Fulton Fish Market still operated out of downtown and would fill the air with the strong scent of tilapia, salmon, and sea bass. But as you got closer to the water, the scent dissipated, and the rhythm of the clave got stronger. You'd pass Pizzeria Uno and the now-defunct bar Sequoia, turn a corner, and boom, a dance floor full of NYC's best steppers, the bass thick enough to swim through. These parties are an important part of maintaining the culture, language, and political power we've seen dwindle as rents have soared. Those Latin dance nights were a formative part of my childhood. Not because I learned how to dance there (I still haven't fully), but because of the experience of the community they provided, the enclave of Latinidad that enveloped you when you walked in.",

The Venezuelan singer-songwriters are the sons of Latine pop icon Ricardo Montaner. However, the talent in the Montaner family doesn't end with Mau, Ricky, and Ricardo. Mau and Ricky's sister, Evaluna Montaner, and their brother-in-law, Camilo, are also impacting the industry. If you listen closely, the elder Evaluna and Camilo's voices can be heard on Mau y Ricky's new album \"Hotel Caracas,\" which also marked the brothers' return to Venezuela for the first time in over a decade. Family and community are core tenets for the duo. \"There's no hiding the obvious,\" Ricky Montaner says of his famous family. \"I'm proud as a family that we've been able to lift each other up, inspire each other, and connect with people in this way. It's beautiful and special.\" Growing up in Caracas, Mau and Ricky saw their father perform big-time hits like \"Tan Enamorados\" and \"Bésame\" to sold-out crowds. He would even bring them on stage to sing with him occasionally. Ricardo also once had a record label with Venezuelan brothers Servando & Florentino. They often rehearsed at home and showed the younger Montaner brothers that a sibling duo in Latin music was possible. Now, the sons are inviting their dad to sing their songs. In a hidden feature on the song \"Muriendo de Miedo,\" Ricardo's voice beautifully harmonizes with his sons'. \"It's full circle,\" Mau Montaner says.",

Rauw Alejandro and Peso Pluma are set to take the stage at the 2024 Governor's Ball in NYC between June 7 and 9. While Becky G and J Balvin performed at the music festival in 2022 and 2021, respectively, this year marks the first time that two Latin music acts are headlining on separate days. And it's about time. Since the 1940s and '50s, when cha cha and mambo took the US by storm, the mass appeal of Latin music has been undeniable. With its mix of West African and Spanish rhythms, the music is inherently danceable, which no doubt has helped genres like salsa and reggaetón break down the language barrier. You don't need to know what Bad Bunny's saying to be able to move to the beat. And yet, for a long time, Latin and African artists could only be found at music festivals that catered to those demographics specifically. This is no longer the case, as major music festivals have recently started including more Latin acts in their lineups. In 2023, Bad Bunny became the first Spanish-language artist to headline Coachella, where Eladio Carrión and Anuel AA also appeared. That same year, iLe, PJ Sin Suela, and Los Rivera Destino performed at the SXSW Music Festival. In 2024, Coachella doubled down on the Latin acts, inviting both Peso Pluma and J. Balvin. And the trend doesn't seem to be stopping. But why has it taken so long for major festivals to get the message that our music is so fire?",

They had already performed at the venue two nights in a row, as well as played a show at Madison Square Garden on May 23. With an audience filled with mostly Dominicans — many of them proudly waving their flags — it was remarkable to see how a genre that was once associated with the bars and brothels of lower-income neighborhoods in the countryside of the Dominican Republic has become such a global phenomenon. And it was Aventura, a boy band formed by four Dominican teenagers in the 1990s, that would completely revolutionize bachata beyond what any of them could have originally envisioned. In February, Romeo Santos announced that he was reuniting with the group for the second time for the Cerrando Ciclos tour, which kicked off on May 1 in Sacramento, CA. The group had last joined forces in 2020, right before the Coronavirus pandemic hit for their Immortal Tour. According to Billboard, it grossed $25.8 million. And while Tuesday evening was far from their last tour performance in the tri-state area, the group really gave their all, exciting the crowd with some of their biggest hits: \"Dile al Amor,\" \"Un Beso,\" \"Todavía Me Amas,\" and their 2021 single with Bad Bunny, \"Volví.\" They closed the show with a guest appearance from Judy Santos for \"Obsesión.\" It took a while for bachata to become a global sensation, but today, even non-Latin music artists like The Weeknd are dipping their toes in the genre.",

But humor was always around me, and I learned at a very young age the power of laughter. My grandmother was a very funny woman. She had this amazing ability to present heavy topics like poverty and even death in ways that were humorous. At first, I used to think it was insensitive, but I quickly learned that it was just a coping mechanism and a way to make things digestible because life was already hard enough.

Read the pieces here. Fabrizio Copano, a rising star in the world of stand-up comedy, isn't your typical Latine comic. His journey, shaped by his Chilean upbringing under a pos-dictatorship and his subsequent disillusionment with the American Dream, fuels a unique comedic perspective that tackles serious political and cultural themes. Copano's early life in Chile was marked by the tail-end of political turmoil. Growing up, he witnessed firsthand the harsh repercussions of Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship, a period characterized by repression, human rights abuses, and a stifling political climate. This experience undoubtedly contrasts the idealized image of the US he received through the media. \"Chile is very Americanized in certain ways, and we look up [to] the US,\" Copano says. \"The culture shock was when I figured out that we are ahead of the US in so many ways because we have already lived through many of the traumas that the US is just now confronting.\" When Copano realized America is \"just as messy,\" it allowed him to view Americans from a more humanistic lens. \"The system isn't as perfect as it pretends to be. I now use this idea in my stand-up, that we're ahead of the US — we are from the future,\" Copano says. Indeed, Copano uses comedy to explore the disillusionment that sets in when the romanticized American dream confronts America's often harsh realities.",

Read the pieces here. One of the things I love about comedy is how it fuses my personality with my purpose. I was diagnosed with depression when I was 14 years old, a time when I began comparing my life to that of my high school peers and quickly noticed the differences. At the time, most of my peers had never experienced significant loss like I had. While they were preoccupied with clothes, gossip, and pop culture, I was grappling with thoughts of death. This numbness to ordinary concerns led me into a deep existential crisis. My struggle with depression was triggered early on by the loss of several family members, including my mother and my grandmother. Processing these losses took years of therapy. Working as a comedian has allowed me to piece together memories like a puzzle to grasp my life's bigger picture. Every time I unravel the layers of my experiences, I discover the humor embedded within them. As a young girl, I didn't know that my biological mother had passed away; I was told to call my grandmother Mama. Although there was a photograph of another woman on the mantle who resembled me, my grandmother would deflect the question whenever I inquired about her. She was a master at making me feel valued and special and was always ready to listen to me chatter, calling me her little Cotorra. I'm not sure if I had a natural sense of humor, but my grandmother certainly saw a big personality in me and nurtured it.",

Sometimes, when you look back from the vantage point — at this point 40 years — we could have made a great little film from a production-value standpoint, and it would have been nothing if we hadn’t made that one decision that captured the imagination of people.”\n\nIn the classic 1984 action/sci-fi flick, Schwarzenegger plays Cyberdyne Systems Model 101, also known as a T-800, or as the world knows the character, The Terminator. The killer cyborg traveled back in time from 2029 to assassinate Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) in an effort to prevent the birth of the person who one day leads a fight against machines. While discussing the film’s impact over the years, Cameron also shared that he doesn’t see it as any type of “Holy Grail” project, saying some components of the film are “cringeworthy” due to the lack of resources they had at the time.",

TV comedy writer, columnist and author Joel Stein makes the case that, while Curb may be a comedy of manners, it’s also the first sitcom about an asshole. By Joel Stein\n\nArtwork by André Carrilho\n\nLarry David by André Carrilho\n\nThe theory I am about to espouse about Curb Your Enthusiasm is wrong. I ran it by executive producer Jeff Schaffer, and he said that never entered his or Larry David’s mind. But it’s also true. There are two reasons Curb was groundbreaking. The first Schaffer agrees with, so I’ll start there. Curb launched just two years after the end of Seinfeld, in which David reinvigorated the sitcom by stripping it down to its comedic bones via his rule of “no hugging and no learning.” Post-Seinfeld, the sitcom powered on for a bit with shows like Friends, Spin City and Suddenly Susan, but it was again in need of reinvention. Curb did that by throwing out the script. Literally. Actors received a detailed outline and improvised all of their lines. David completely jettisoned the practice of staying in the writers’ room until 2 a.m. to beat a joke. This innovation forced the situations in situation comedy—not just the jokes—to be funny. It also made the show feel alive. “Even the audition was fun,” says my friend John Ross Bowie, who appeared in a 2009 episode with his wife, Jamie Denbo. “You don’t need to get off book.",

The limited series marks the new installment of Murphy’s “Monster” franchise with the streamer, following the massive success of “Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,” starring Evan Peters. Ian Brennan partnered with the mega-producer once more to bring the Menendez brothers’ story to screen, from their traumatic upbringing to the notorious night they murdered their parents, José and Kitty Menendez. The limited series seeks to discover who the real monsters in the high-profile murder trial were. The Menendez brothers captivated America, as their televised Court TV trial is one of the first of its kind. The two boys killed their parents on Aug. 20, 1989, at only 18 and 21 years old. Their counsel called it self defense, but both were convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole after two trials. Helping propel the story along is a period-specific soundtrack featuring the likes of Vanilla Ice and, in a show of irony from Murphy, the embattled brotherly duo of Milli Vanilli. If you’re looking for a handy rundown of the complete “Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story” song list, here’s a guide to all the songs in the new series. Episode 1, “Blame It on the Rain”\n\n“Songbird” by Kenny G\n\n“Girl You Know It’s True” by Milli Vanilli\n\n“Girl I’m Gonna Miss You” by Milli Vanilli\n\n“Blame It on the Rain” by Milli Vanilli\n\nEpisode 2, “Spree”\n\n“Ice Ice Baby” by Vanilla Ice\n\nEpisode 3, “Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?”\n\n“Dirty Cash (Money Talks)” by The Adventures of Stevie V\n\n“The Power” by Snap!",

The artist (a.k.a. Justin Vernon) just announced an extremely welcome three-song EP called SABLE,—his first new music under the Bon Iver name since 2019’s i,i. The new tracks “serve as a reset and reintroduction,” Vernon said in a press release, noting that he was “stripping the project down to the primary elements on which it was originally founded.” You can hear that directive in his delicate, meditative new track “S P E Y S I D E,” which sees the artist return after so many years to the sound he pioneered over a decade ago in songs like “Blood Bank” and “Re: Stacks.”\n\n“Emerging from a slow-burning breakdown—possibly done with music, thinking increasingly about the process of healing—SABLE, is a space for Vernon to unpack the darkness, pressure and anxiety that amounted to one of the most trying periods of his life,” the press release continues. You can hear that raw emotion all over the lyrics of the new song, as well as the album’s title, which was “named for near-blackness” itself. “I know now that I can’t make good/I wish I could,” Vernon sings at the beginning of the track, with only his acoustic guitar for company. Later, he closes with, “But maybe you can still make a man from me/here on Speyside quay/with what’s left of me/as you live and breathe/I really know now what had hold on me.”\n\nWith his autumn-themed album i,i, Vernon finished the seasons cycle he began in 2007 with For Emma, Forever Ago (winter) and continued through 2011 with Bon Iver, Bon Iver (spring) and 2016 with 22, A Million (summer).",

What is it about Colin Farrell’s Oz Cobb (not Cobblepott, the character having been stripped of half of his usual name, alongside his historical attachments to generational power or wealth, in the transition to TV) that’s worth spending eight hours with? Those hoping to find the answer in the pages of the comics the show is ostensibly based on will likely come away scratching their heads. Set in the same rust-dusted version of Gotham City as Matt Reeves’ 2022 reboot project The Batman—a comic-book movie already so “grounded” as to be borderline subterranean—showrunner Lauren LeFranc’s show couldn’t be less interested in trick umbrellas, capes, or cinematic action of any but the most brutal and utilitarian varieties. Change the building signs, strip out a few references to “Arkham” and the Riddler’s late-film attack on the city, and this pilot could be from any of a dozen shows about a mid-tier criminal with delusions of upper-tier success anywhere in America. Which leaves us with Oswald Cobb himself, and Farrell’s efforts to take this character—a loose collection of crime-guy tropes, prosthetics, and quirks energized by The Batman‘s only truly fun performance—and build a workable TV protagonist out of him. Step one is to lessen him, the better for both threats and upward mobility: The Penguin from the film was comfortable playing king of the castle, albeit one beholden to the boss (Jon Turturro); here, the show makes it clear that Cobb is middle-management at best, serving at the whims of the nigh-aristocratic Falcone crime family.",

But you can also palpably feel the gaps where mentions of Gaiman’s “genius”—or even an appearance from the man himself—would normally go in a promo like this, presumably sucked into the void by the sexual assault allegations against the prominent author. Sandman is a big enough deal for Netflix that it’s unlikely to go the way of Dead Boy Detectives (which was canceled last month) any time in the immediate future, but it’s clear the streamer is feeling a little leery about how tightly it’s tied its brand to Gaiman’s in the lead-up to the show.",

Hadn’t we learned from Deathly Hallows or Mockingjay? What about the three-part The Hobbit fiasco? Sure, that last one might be asking a little too much. Peter Jackson didn’t even learn from his own mistakes, and is absurdly splitting Andy Serkis’ upcoming Lord Of The Rings prequel, The Hunt For Gollum, into two parts. But Chu is insisting that he’s not that girl and knows everyone hates a “Part One.” In fact, he chose to leave the qualifier out of Wicked‘s title altogether. “This isn’t half the homework,” he explained to Entertainment Weekly of his decision. “If we were going to split it into two, we need to make sure that movie one is emotionally satisfying and by the end, you feel like that was a f—ing movie. [sic] I don’t like movies where you leave and feel like, ‘Well, I’ve got to wait for the next one.’ This should leave you with the highest of highs and so connected to these women.”\n\nOver the past few months, longtime fans have expressed a bit of confusion over the fact that the entirety of the Wicked stage show clocks in under three hours, which means Chu and his team are going to have to pad a lot to get two full blockbusters out of it.",

Vance, on the Emmys stage, joking, “So, as they say, my work here is done.”\n\nWell, the work ain’t over so long as history keeps rhyming, huh? As it happens, CNN’s TV On The Edge: Moments That Shape Our Culture will kick off this weekend with a retrospective on Murphy Brown vs. Dan Quayle. The program, which explores impactful moments on television, reunites Bergen with Murphy Brown creator and executive producer Diane English, director Barnet Kellman, and writer Korby Siamis to discuss the pregnancy plot line and the firestorm it unintentionally created. “It was just relentless, and I just hid behind my curtain. I mean, I was really afraid to go out,” Bergen says in an exclusive clip shared with The A.V.",

Club, but we found just the right book to relaunch the format: The Third Gilmore Girl by Kelly Bishop, which debuted September 17 via Simon & Schuster. In her memoir, Bishop recounts her life in the entertainment industry, from her turbulent childhood to her start as a dancer in Radio City Music Hall’s Corps de Ballet to her Tony-winning performance in the original cast of A Chorus Line on Broadway, to her role as the sophisticated matriarch of the Gilmore family. She also reveals intimate details of her personal life, including the ups and downs of her relationships with family, friends, and lovers. After reading The Third Gilmore Girl, A.V. Club staffers Mary Kate Carr and Cindy White got together for a very book club-style conversation about the book and what they learned from it. We’ll look for your thoughts in the comments section. Were you a fan of Kelly Bishop before reading the book? How much did you know about her going in? MKC: Like many millennials I know Kelly Bishop best from Gilmore Girls—I’ve seen it a few times through and used to watch it with my little sister, so it’s got a special place in my heart. I’ve also obviously seen Dirty Dancing. And I knew she became famous as a Broadway star, I was vaguely aware she had a Tony, but I had no idea until reading the breadth of her stage career.",

Her asking, “You don’t remember my name?” was a pointed insult at the Rings Of Power faithful, who were more than willing to learn her name had anyone introduced us! Celebrimbor and Mirdania’s (Amelia Kenworthy) discombobulation is a symptom of the upheaval traveling throughout Middle-earth. Everyone, even those who supposedly know Sauron best and who have killed him before, is missing the forest for the trees. The path may be split in two, but most choose to walk into Sauron’s trap. For now, the problem is generational. Savvy Sauron dug his claws into party elders—your King Durins, your Lord Celembrimbors, your Ar-Pharazôns. They’re fools to do his dirty work (oh yeah), and it’s going over gangbusters with the Dark Lord. Whether it’s the endless pursuit of gold or feeding your political opponents to a giant cephalopod known as the Sea-worm, these rulers weaponize their standing to fit Sauron’s needs. And it’s not just the Valar’s creations turning on their leaders. In our mid-season check-in with Arondir, we overhear two Orcs—apologies, two Uruk—complaining about Adar, whom they characterize as chasing ghosts (presumably Sauron). Even among the Orcs, Middle-earth’s current leadership is overstaying its welcome. Unfortunately, like so many septuagenarian politicians, King Durin refuses to retire, and like so many children of septuagenarians, Prince Durin can’t convince him to hang up the crown.",

The result, pleasant enough but frustratingly bland, exists in a soupy, ill-defined emotional middle ground—occasionally amusing but not quite funny, and unable (or unwilling) to substantively commit to thoughtful, penetrating melancholia. Written and directed by Bernardo Britto, the Florida-set Omni Loop centers on Zoya Lowe (Mary-Louise Parker), a theoretical physicist who, along with her husband Donald (Carlos Jacott), has written a series of academic textbooks. Diagnosed with a black hole in between her lungs, Zoya is given a week to live, and sent home to spend that time with her small family, which includes daughter Jayne (Hannah Pearl Utt). When her nose starts to bleed during an early birthday celebration, Zoya excuses herself, slips into the bathroom and pops a regenerating pill from a bottle in her medicine cabinet, which takes her back to the hospital five days earlier. This reaction isn’t a magical, one-off fluke of some prescription medication, though; it spoils nothing (since the movie actually opens with 12-year-old Zoya finding a pill bottle) to note that she has had this ability her entire adult life. In conflict with the terminal nature of her diagnosis, Zoya crosses paths with Paula (Ayo Edebiri), a student at a local university. Needing both lab access as well as a sounding board, Zoya recruits Paula to help attempt to unravel the chemical composition of the pills, perhaps then allowing her to stave off death.",

        "text": "The first half of the first episode of Agatha All Along is absolutely terrifying, but not on purpose. The show it spun off from, WandaVision, was a loving homage to television sitcoms, with each episode based on a different decade of American TV. The gimmick worked, for the most part, not just because of its cleverness, but because of the writers’ clear respect for and understanding of the history of television. Because of its unique setup, Marvel did a big pre-release push that laid out the basic conceit of the show, specifically highlighting the different decades and intentional callbacks. Viewers knew what they were getting into with WandaVision, even if they didn’t understand the metatextual purpose of the homages at the start of the series. With Agatha All Along, the messaging hasn’t been nearly as clear. Actor Joe Locke told Total Film that “every episode has a different classic horror/thriller film that it is basing itself off,” but the phrasing of that is ambiguous, and it’s not a point that Marvel has pushed particularly hard. Still, there was always a chance that Agatha would try to mimic WandaVision stylistically. The setup, after all, was kind of perfect for a re-do. Each of WandaVision’s nine episodes digs a little deeper into what, exactly, is going on. Eventually, we learn that after the death of her partner, Vision (Paul Bettany), Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) created an illusion around the town of Westview, New Jersey, trapping all the residents in a collective delusion, one marked by the tropes of the sitcoms Wanda took comfort in as a child.",

Releasing in theaters in February, and then sticking around for more than two months (to say nothing of its various recuts and re-releases), the film made more than $600 million at the box office, quickly becoming the most successful R-rated movie of all time. (A title it only lost this past summer, as Deadpool & Wolverine found at least one way they were, in fact, bigger than Jesus.) And now, it’s apparently coming back. This is per Consequence, reporting on a piece printed in Italpress, which states that Gibson is reportedly in Malta at the moment, holding conversations with Maltese authorities about using the island nation as a filming location for a new movie: The Passion Of The Christ: Resurrection, with an eye toward beginning filming in 2025. Neither Gibson, nor star Jim Caviezel, who’s set to return for the sequel, have been shy about their ambitions to get The Passion Of The Christ 2 made. Gibson initially announced the project back in 2016, and Caviezel made his own enthusiasm for the return clear in 2018, saying he expected the movie to be “The biggest film in history.” Gibson even gave a glimpse at plot details in 2022, when he suggested that his script for the movie was less grounded than the first film, which got a lot of its appeal from being a straightforward—if brutally violent—depiction of the story of Christ.",

Not content to settle into his “unlikable paleontologist” niche, Schwimmer has done a lot of different projects in the years since the show went off the air, pulling in critical acclaim for work like his portrayal of Robert Kardashian in The People Vs. O.J. Simpson, and offering up oddball comedy choices like his AppleTV+ series Intelligence. But, excepting his voice work in the Madagascar films, he’s never been what you might call a movie star, and Schwimmer himself has a three-word explanation for why that is: Men In Black. Appearing recently on the Origins With Cush Jumbo podcast, Schwimmer casts his decision to reject a lead role in Barry Sonnenfeld’s comedy sci-fi blockbuster as a major turning point in his career. Asked if he turned down the lead role in MIB due to scheduling conflicts with Friends, Schwimmer clarified that, no, the movie had been aimed directly at a gap in filming for the NBC mega-hit. The issue: Schwimmer had already booked that time to direct his first film, working with numerous members of his old Chicago theater company for a small-budget comedy called Since You’ve Been Gone.",

The sketch show is heading into its 50th season (! ), but its new slate of hosts is anything but a midlife crisis. The season officially returns on September 28 with two faces we just saw front and center at this past weekend’s Emmy Awards. Hacks star Jean Smart will be taking the reins for the premiere of the landmark season, with the Emmys’ in memoriam crooner Jelly Roll taking on musical duties. But SNL did us one better today, announcing all the hosts through November 2 (that’s through the rest of election season, for the politically minded). There are some very familiar faces (John Mulaney! Stevie Nicks!) and some newcomers (the ascendant Chappell Roan, who Bowen Yang was pitching for the show over the summer). The whole list is as follows:\n\nSept. 28 – Jean Smart / Jelly Roll\n\nOct. 5 – Nate Bargatze / Coldplay\n\nOct. 12 – Ariana Grande / Stevie Nicks\n\nOct. 19 – Michael Keaton / Billie Eilish\n\nNov. 2 – John Mulaney / Chappell Roan\n\nIn addition to returning favorites like Yang, Mikey Day, Ego Nwodim, Sarah Sherman, and Kenan Thompson, the hosts will also play opposite three new cast members: Ashley Padilla, Emil Wakim, and Jane Wickline. Per Variety, Padilla has been a member of the Groundlings since 2021 and has made appearances on Curb Your Enthusiasm and Night Court.

DeGeneres has said so in no uncertain terms; she even named the tour from whence this material sprung “Ellen’s Last Stand…Up Tour.” And on that tour, she vowed that after Ellen DeGeneres: For Your Approval, which premieres on Netflix on September 24, we’d never see her again. That imbues this special with an extra level of excitement and intrigue, given that it’s a goodbye to one of the most successful and visible comedians of a generation. Then again, Hollywood types rarely ever stick to their retirements, so it’s hard to imagine this will really be the last we see of her. Netflix is doing its best to make us believe the hype by reiterating that this is “The final comedy special of her historic career,” in which “Ellen gets personal and reveals what she’s been doing since being ‘kicked out of show business.’ From the mundane world of raising chickens and parallel parking to the harsh reality of becoming a brand name celebrity, she goes deep into her stand-up roots and brings the laughs through life’s most real and absurd realities.”\n\nIn the trailer, at least, DeGeneres isn’t leaning too heavily on saying goodbye or making her final bow overly nostalgic. The material is focused a lot on her so-called cancellation, which probably contributed to her so-called retirement.",

According to Nielsen data, YouTube accounted for 10.6% of all streaming activity on connected TV devices last month, with Netflix and Prime Video trailing with 7.9% and 3.1% respectively. (Everyone else clocked in at less than 3%.) To celebrate their victory, the creator-friendly platform is… changing up their TV app to look a lot more like all the other platforms they just beat. It sounds like their marketing team maybe could have benefited from watching a few more YouTube videos on standing out from the crowd. The company announced its plans for the TV app at a Made on YouTube event in New York on Wednesday, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The updated interface will better organize content into season and episode distinctions like you’d see on any other platform, which means Hot Ones might actually have to stick to its season finales going forward. (If they don’t completely move to Netflix, that is.) In the coming months, the app will also start rolling out “immersive previews” like the ones you see when you linger on a Netflix show page for too long. “A ton of our creators are really leaning into [a more traditional television format],” Christian Oestlien, YouTube’s VP of product management, told THR. “They’re doing 20 to 40 minute videos, there’s kind of a season arc to it, there’s multiple episodes in it, so we’re giving them the tooling to really create what we’re calling Creator Show Pages so that if you’re a fan of Michelle Khare (for example), you can go to her channel page and actually just kind of go on that sort of binge episodic experience that I think the lean back TV environment really lends itself to.”\n\nAccording to the company, these are more than just aesthetic tweaks.",

Last week, when a bunch of non-metal heads probably learned that the “Jane Says” rockers had reunited for the first time in 14 years in the first place, lead singer Perry Farrell made headlines for taking a swing at guitarist Dave Navarro onstage. The band apologized after a video of Farrell getting literally dragged off the stage spread across the internet, and canceled the rest of the tour shortly after. Now, they have a new song out. Let us breathe, Jane’s Addiction! If the track, titled “True Love,” is a eulogy for the band, it sure is an ironic one. “When I first felt true love, I was very young/I tried to describe it to my friends/You’re floating in something that’s way over your head/Wading in the waters of true love,” Farrell sings, before proclaiming that he’s “Yearning to be again with my true love” at the end of the ballad. According to NME, the band debuted the song live in London earlier this year and have played it at a handful of shows since. It was presumably scheduled to come out this week regardless of the fight, and the band (or their managers) decided not to let it crumble into obscurity. The artists have been totally silent about the release on social media, however, so we may never know.",

Directed from a screenplay co-written by Kevin Coughlin and Ryan Grassby, the film follows a young mother and her two sons who reside in a secluded forest cabin that was built with love—and ample spiritual protection—by elder relatives who felt an evil presence slowly encroaching toward them. Melding survival, psychological, and supernatural elements, Never Let Go is a thrilling ride in its entirety, a feat achieved by the stellar performances from its core trio. Even if the film’s mythology is never fully unraveled, Aja’s tension-crafting easily makes up for the odd narrative misstep. Young twin brothers Samuel (Anthony B. Jenkins) and Nolan (Percy Daggs IV) have only ever explored their rustic, hand-carved home and the overgrown greenery that directly surrounds it. They haven’t even had the luxury of running around in the wilderness, as their Momma (Halle Berry) demands that they all tie themselves to ropes that remain tethered to the property whenever they wish to step off the front porch. You see, Momma’s parents imbued the house with a divine aura that deters malicious spirits from entering, but as soon as one loses contact with the property, they are instantly vulnerable to possession. Therefore, the rope provides a holy loophole. During one of their routine expeditions into the forest to hunt for sustenance, Samuel trips and is accidentally freed from the rope’s grip. Momma swoops in just in time, reconnecting her son to the rope just as a bloody, fork-tongued creature advances toward the boy; interestingly, only she can see these monsters, a fact that makes Nolan increasingly suspicious of his mother’s fervent belief in the metaphysical.",

Beast Games, the upcoming Prime series from YouTube personality MrBeast, is the latest game show to face allegations of mistreatment and “chaos” from its contestants. Now, five of those anonymous participants are suing MrBeast (real name Jimmy Donaldson) and Amazon for, among other things, failure to pay minimum wages and overtime, sexual harassment and failure to prevent harassment, negligent infliction of emotional distress, failure to provide uninterrupted meal breaks, and false advertising. The suit is currently seeking class action status. With over 1,000 participants competing for a single $5 million cash prize, Beast Games is touting itself as the largest reality show in history, according to Variety. MrBeast is known on YouTube for over-the-top challenges like “I Spent 50 Hours Buried Alive” and his own version of Squid Game, which he launched two years ago.

Fox’s adaptation of the Karl Alberg series of books strikes a tone reminiscent of 2000s-era WB shows like Everwood and Gilmore Girls: It’s lightly comedic, airy, and everything is centered around a quirky small town. In this case, however, there’s a crucial bit of darkness woven in, not just from the titular killing but from the suggestion of the secrets that lurk under the surface of every small town. This is well-worn territory, sure, but the show strikes a jovial enough tone and manages to be somewhat unique without coming across as discomforting. Mercifully, Murder In A Small Town doesn’t play up the folksiness of its setting or the out-of-touch nature of its protagonist. Karl Alberg (Rossif Sutherland, son of Donald) has moved to a small coastal town from the big city, but he’s adjusted rather well. We’re introduced to him as he goes on an online date with Cassandra Mitchell (WB veteran Kristin Kreuk), a local librarian with attachment issues. The show’s setup actually has a lot more to juggle than the murder, because there’s also Edwina Yen (Mya Lowe), a new hire from Philadelphia, and George Wilcox (special guest star James Cromwell), who’s connected to the victim somehow. Murder In A Small Town is not always the cleanest.

Word of mouth certainly used to be a thing, but there’s no reason it still can’t be. Wrapping up a six-month run at New York’s beloved IFC Center arthouse, Alice Rohrwacher’s enchanting La Chimera opened in March and hasn’t left the screen since. The movie is currently the theater’s longest-running film of the decade, and its miraculous run comes to an end this weekend. To celebrate the film’s unprecedented and inspiring success, Neon, the film’s distributor, is buying out the theater so everyone can say buona notte to the movie the right way. Tickets to La Chimera’s final shows at 11 a.m. and 9:45 p.m. on Thursday, September 19, will be on Neon.

Warner Bros., which should get credit for actually releasing this movie (we were getting nervous), will release Mickey 17 in the United States on January 31, 2025, more than two years after production concluded. It’s hard to imagine what concerned Warner Bros. about Mickey 17 because it looks like a totally normal movie featuring a movie star doing a regular Tobey Maguire accent. Pattinson stars as Mickey 1 through 17, a go-nowhere Earthling so desperate to leave his home planet that he signs up to be an expendable, a grunt worker expected to die on the job only to be 3-D printed back into existence. While Mickey seems fine dying for a living, things get a little complicated once there are overlaps between versions. When Mickey wakes up in bed with Mickey, the instinct is to kill Mickey—see: a super normal two-and-a-half hour movie in which Pattinson routinely dies or kills himself or allows someone else to kill him. Bong is known for taking big swings like this.

Murphy recently told Vanity Fair that he had his eye on the project, an adaptation of Claire Keegan’s acclaimed 2020 novel of the same name, before he ever stepped foot in Christopher Nolan’s vision of Los Alamos. It was there that he pitched the script, written by Enda Walsh, to his co-star Matt Damon, who “loved” it. “I remember saying that it’s a different film, but it would share some thematic crossover with Manchester By The Sea, which Matt also produced,” Murphy recalled. “It was like I was pitching between Manchester By The Sea and Doubt.” Damon and Ben Affleck’s Artists Equity signed on as producers and everything came together “remarkably quick” from there. The film, which just released its first trailer, is a notable change of pace for Murphy from last year’s massive blockbuster. The actor goes back to his Irish roots as Bill Furlong, a coal merchant confronted with “his past and the complicit silence of a small Irish town controlled by the Catholic Church,” according to the film’s logline. The 1980s-set story was loosely inspired by the Magdalene Laundries, a dark chapter in Irish history in which Catholic nuns isolated and abused single, pregnant women until the final facility closed in 1996. ﻿\n\n“It’s so seemingly simple, but it’s incredibly complex, actually, when you look at it,” Murphy said of the story.",

        "text": "Let me start by saying Concussions is a great name for a bar in general, but especially for a regular hangout for stunt workers. Since 1964, this (sadly fictional) spot has “cater[ed] to lunatics who take a beating.” And in OMITB‘s fourth episode, the haven is intruded by three desperate podcast hosts. Charles, Oliver, and Mabel’s inquiry into Sazz’s regular bar leads to meeting many eccentric folks, including a Paul Rudd lookalike played by…Paul Rudd! They learn about Sazz’s last day, part of which she spent at the watering hole. Charles also helps her bar colleagues throw a traditional stuntman funeral, which involves bashing bottles and a brawl. The episode is a mixed bag, continuing OMITB season four’s trend of—dare I say it—being slightly lackluster. It’s not a bad half-hour, to be clear, as there are solid one-liners, and Steve Martin and Martin Short remain stellar. Yet the arcs don’t feel fun or suspenseful enough. The installment’s strongest aspect is the internal and external ways in which Charles continues to handle his grief. Aside from the usual banter, it’s nice to see the three leads face the emotional ramifications of the crimes they talk about all day. This has happened before in the show, with how Mabel dealt with her old Arconia friends’ deaths in season one and the impacts of Bunny (Jayne Houdyshell) and Ben Glenroy’s (Rudd) murders. The trio is committed to the podcast, but this shit can get dark and affect their lives.",

        "text": "In 2008, filmmaker Mike Leigh released Happy-Go-Lucky, a bright and breezy comedy (as alluded to by its title) that still managed to have the occasional dramatic bite. Hard Truths provides the antithesis, a film about sisters that plays as an unsettling social drama full of tears, bitterness, and familial consternation, but also contains a dash of humor that makes it far more than just about the dourness of a grieving daughter. Leigh’s films are filled with deeply realized characters, quotidian situations that manage to feel epic, and exquisite interplay of dialogue that feels extremely casual but, of course, is deeply calculated on the page before a frame is shot. Despite Hard Truths’ somewhat claustrophobic interior settings, Leigh along with his long-time cinematographer Dick Pope use subtle camera movements and clever compositions to keep even the most austere spaces engaging. Just as Leigh’s proclivity for chamber piece-like narratives is well known, his ability to showcase supreme acting talent is equally legendary. Here the main focus is on Marianne Jean-Baptiste in an astonishing turn, a wild and explosive character realized with multiple layers of nuance that lay sometimes hidden amongst the wild rantings. Oscar-nominated for Leigh’s 1996 Palme d’Or winner Secrets & Lies, Jean-Baptiste plays a force of nature, mining a deep vein of acerbic misery. Jean-Baptiste plays Pansy, the mother to the taciturn Moses (Tuwaine Barrett) and married to his henpecked father Curtley (David Webber). Pansy’s proclivity for confrontation is unrelenting, be it in the confines of her home or in the checkout line at a grocery store. It’s a character that could easily become tiresome, a two-dimensional ranting bulldozer, laying waste to all those in her path.",

Gadd ushered the story from a one man show at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival to an award-winning hit miniseries on Netflix. Now, he’s got a first-look deal to continue developing new stories for the platform. According to Deadline, Gadd secured a multi-year deal for scripted content. There was reportedly some competition with HBO for Gadd’s talents; the premium channel will host his new BBC series Lions. However, the Netflix deal has apparently been in the works since last month, after Baby Reindeer had racked up all its Emmy nominations. “I’m beyond thrilled to be continuing my creative journey with Netflix,” Gadd said in a statement. “They took a chance on me when I wasn’t proven in the television space for that I will always be grateful. I look forward to the years ahead with Netflix ideas with Ted, Bela [Bajaria], Anne [Mensah], Peter [Friedlander] and all the amazing staff who work at the company.”\n\nNetflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos confirmed the partnership at The Royal Television Society‘s London Convention on Tuesday, praising Baby Reindeer as an “enormous hit around the world,” per The Hollywood Reporter. He said, “I can give you a bit of news this morning, we have finished our first-look deal with Richard Gadd to do his first work at Netflix.",

The couple, who were in their 40s at the time of their deaths in 1989, were killed in their Beverly Hills, California, home. While their sons are incarcerated, José and Kitty are buried at Princeton Cemetery in New Jersey. Lyle and Erik became infamous criminals following the case, reportedly spending around $700,000, according to Time Magazine. With renewed attention on the case, many are asking who José and Kitty Menendez were and what led to their deaths. Why Did Lyle and Erik Kill Their Parents? At the time of the murders, Lyle was 21 and Erik was 18. During their trial, which began in 1993, the brothers claimed they had been abused by their parents throughout their childhood, accusing José of sexual abuse and Kitty of drug addiction and alcoholism. In 1996, Lyle and Erik were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for the murders of their parents. Erik confessed to his and Lyle’s actions during a therapy session with psychologist Dr. Jerome Oziel, who then told his mistress, Judalon Smyth. Smyth reported the information to the police. What Did José and Kitty Menendez Do for Work? José, born in Havana, Cuba, in 1944, moved to the United States in 1960, where he eventually met his wife, Kitty.

Now, 35 years later, the Menendez brothers are the latest subjects of Ryan Murphy and Ian Brennan‘s Monster anthology series. Titled Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, the series stars Nicholas Alexander Chavez and Cooper Koch as Lyle and Erik, with Javier Bardem and Chloë Sevigny portraying their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez. The 10-episode season intends to explore whether the siblings were cold-blooded killers seeking to inherit their family’s fortune, as the prosecution argued, or victims of a lifetime of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse at the hands of their parents, as the defense claimed and the brothers maintain to this day. Before delving into the new series—now streaming on Netflix—here’s more about the Monster‘s real-life story and what led to the brothers’ arrest. What Did the Menendez Brothers Do? Lyle and Erik shot and killed their parents in August 1989 with shotguns, firing a total of 14 times at their Beverly Hills home. When police first investigated the crime scene, they initially suspected mob involvement due to the extreme violence of the murders. How Were the Menendez Brothers Caught? After Jose and Kitty were brutally shot to death in their Beverly Hills mansion, Lyle and Erik Menendez spent money recklessly, burning through an estimated $700,000 of their parents’ wealth on cars, jewelry, and even purchasing restaurants and cafes.",

According to Mediaite, the sit-down — which was pre-taped on Tuesday for Friday’s Firing Line — became contentious when Hoover grilled the former Fox News star about the alleged $32 million that was paid out to women who accused him of sexual harassment during his tenure at the conservative news network. (O’Reilly was fired from Fox News in 2017 after The New York Times went public with the settlements.) Author @BillOReilly discusses his new book, the presidency, and the state of conservative media.

In a statement to Mediaite, Hoover said, “It’s disappointing that Bill O’Reilly, knowing he would be asked, has not reflected on how the settlements involving him and several women have affected their ability to earn a living in media again, even as he continues to, in his words, ‘flourish’ in independent media.’ This is my seventh year hosting Firing Line, and Bill O’Reilly was the first guest on the program who didn’t formally finish the interview through the ‘goodbyes.’ Clearly, he was uncomfortable fielding questions related to the sexual harassment allegations that are a significant part of his legacy.",

The When Calls the Heart spinoff — which originated on Hallmark in 2019 with a 10-episode Season 1, then relocated to Great American Family in 2021 for a pair of Christmas episodes — has been renewed for Season 2 at GAF. But the cast is getting something of an overhaul, with three new additions announced ahead of air. When Hope Calls initially followed sisters Lillian Walsh (played by Sullivan’s Crossing’s Morgan Kohan) and Grace Bennett (Chicago Fire’s Jocelyn Hudon) to the town of Brookfield, circa 1916. The series “centered on the town’s orphanage and its residents who meet tremendous challenges while creating a hopeful, faith-filled community on the cusp of change in the frontier town,” according to the official logline. Ryan-James Hatanaka co-starred as Lillian’s love interest, Mountie Gabriel. In the Season 1 finale, Grace departed for London — and when the series resurfaced on Great American Family in 2021, Hudon did not return. Lillian revealed that her sister had put down roots in the UK; her Season 1 love interest Chuck (played by former series regular Greg Hovanessian) also skipped town. Jocelyn Hudon & Morgan Kohan in When Hope Calls Season 1 Shane Mahood/Hallmark Entertainment (Courtesy of Everett Collection)\n\nAccording to GAF, while the opening episodes of Season 2 will “pay homage to the romance” between Lillian and Gabriel, “new characters are introduced that are seminal to the orphanage and children, the sprawling farms and ranch lands, and to the town of Brookfield.” Those include Cindy Busby (Cedar Cove), who has been cast as Nora; Christopher Russell (UnREAL), who will play a new mountie, Michael; and Nick Bateman (A Christmas Miracle With Daisy), who will inhabit the role of Wyatt.",

In the above first look at Season 2 (premiering Thursday, Dec. 26) — released as part of the streamer’s Geeked Week 2024 — Seong Gi-hun is pulled back into the deadly world of the game, which “will not stop,” the teaser ominously warns. Across nine episodes, Squid Game Season 1 followed Seong Gi-hun (played by Emmy winner Lee Jung-jae), a gambling-prone divorcé, as he and 455 other strangers were whisked away to a secret island complex to compete in a series of children’s games all given decidedly deadly spins. Ultimately emerging from the ordeal as the sole survivor, Gi-hun made tracks for the airport to visit his daughter in Los Angeles. But when he saw the man who groomed him for the game doing the same with another stranger, Gi-hun snatched a calling card from the stranger, dialed the number and announced his intention to find out who exactly the game’s organizers were and why they engage in the atrocities they do. While the finale left us wondering exactly how Gi-hun will do that, the Season 2 synopsis — coupled with the video below — makes clear that he will tracksuit up again, as No. 456, and step back into the deadly arena.

Our reinforcement learning-based approach has helped us reduce energy consumption and water usage across various weather conditions in our data centers. Meta is revamping its new data center design to optimize for artificial intelligence and the same methodology will be applicable for future data center optimizations as well. Efficiency is one of the key components of Meta’s approach to designing, building, and operating sustainable data centers. Besides the IT load, cooling is the primary consumer of energy and water in the data center environment. Improving the cooling efficiency helps reduce our energy use, water use, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and also helps address one of the greatest challenges of all – climate change. Most of Meta’s existing data centers use outdoor air and evaporative cooling systems to maintain environmental conditions within the envelope of temperature between 65°F and 85°F (18°C and 30°C) and relative humidity between 13 and 80%. As water and energy are consumed in the conditioning of this air, optimizing the amount of supply airflow that has to be conditioned is a high priority in terms of improving operational efficiency. Since 2021, we have been leveraging AI to optimize the amount of airflow supply into data centers for cooling purposes. Using simulator-based reinforcement learning, we have, on average, reduced the supply fan energy consumption at one of the pilot regions by 20% and water usage by 4% across various weather conditions. Previously, we shared how a physics-based thermal simulator helps us optimize our data centers’ environmental controls.",

This new metric allows us to measure server resource usage (e.g., compute, storage) and efficiency in our large-scale data center server fleet in near real-time. We are sharing our learnings in adopting depreciation methods for accumulated carbon assets for internal fleet measurements, and encourage further industry improvement and development on these concepts. This is not intended to replace global emissions accounting standards for purposes of external reporting. Since 2020, Meta has maintained net zero emissions in our operations and matched 100% of our electricity use with renewable energy. However, we know our work doesn’t stop there, and we recognize our responsibility to decarbonize our footprint beyond our data centers and offices, including emissions from the server components our suppliers manufacture to our employees’ commutes. To align with the Paris Agreement, we have set a goal to reach net zero emissions across our value chain in 2030. Meta’s Net Zero Program has three foundational pillars: understanding our emissions, reducing our emissions, and removing remaining emissions. To understand our emissions, improving the granularity, accuracy, and near real-time measurement of our greenhouse gas data goes beyond carbon accounting. The right data will help us apply actionable metrics to advance decarbonization across our business operations and with our suppliers. With this in mind, we have created the Real Time Infrastructure Accounting for Sustainability (RETINAS) initiative, which seeks to study and understand the impact of server reliability, performance, and operational optimization on Meta’s Scope 3 emissions.",

The company pointed to research showing that the UK is ranked seventh on a global AI readiness index for data and infrastructure, and called for a number of policy changes. Google’s UK managing director, Debbie Weinstein, said that the government “sees the opportunity” in AI but needs to introduce more policies boosting its deployment. “We have a lot of advantages and a lot of history of leadership in this space, but if we do not take proactive action, there is a risk that we will be left behind,” she said. AI is undergoing a global investment boom after breakthroughs in the technology led by the release of the ChatGPT chatbot, from the US company OpenAI, and other companies like Google, which has produced a powerful AI model called Gemini. However, government-backed AI projects have been early victims of cost-cutting by Keir Starmer’s government. In August, Labour confirmed it would not push ahead with unfunded commitments of £800m for the creation of an exascale supercomputer – considered key infrastructure for AI research – and a further £500m for the AI Research Resource, which funds computing power for AI. Asked about the supercomputer decision, Weinstein referred to the government’s forthcoming “AI action plan” under the tech entrepreneur Matt Clifford. “We’re hopeful to see a really comprehensive view around what are the investments that we need to make in the UK,” she said.",

Much has clearly changed since. Some of the earliest preachers of the brave new teleworking world – including the US tech companies Google and Microsoft – are among the most vocal to repent. This week Amazon joined their ranks, handing down an edict to corporate employees demanding they return to the office five days a week, effective from 2 January. The chief executive, Andy Jassy, argues there are “significant” advantages to face-to-face working. Others, including Goldman Sachs, Boots and Barclays, agree, as growing numbers of companies push to limit remote working. At Tesla, Elon Musk has a typically outspoken approach, telling staff unwilling to return to the office full-time they can “pretend to work elsewhere”. However, it is also clear the pre-pandemic working landscape will never be entirely rebuilt. After the initial push to return employees to the office after lockdown, flexible practices and the balance of power between bosses and workers is back on the agenda as the new Labour government promises a radical redrawing of employment rights. Expected within weeks, the plans include make flexible working the default option for workers from day one on the job. Since the last lockdown ended three years ago, most employers have introduced some form of mandatory in-office work requirement. However, research by VirginMedia O2 suggests only a minority – four in 10 firms – demand staff are at their desks five days a week. Over time, this figure could rise, with a KPMG survey of UK chief executives published on Wednesday reporting that 83% believe there will be a return to pre-pandemic ways of working within the next three years, up from 64% a year ago.",

The FTC report published on Thursday looked at the data-gathering practices of Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, Discord, Reddit, Amazon, Snap, TikTok and Twitter/X between January 2019 and 31 December 2020. The majority of the companies’ business models incentivized tracking how people engaged with their platforms, collecting their personal data and using it to determine what content and ads users see on their feeds, the report states. The FTC’s findings validate years of reporting on the depth and breadth of these companies’ tracking practices and call out the tech firms for “vast surveillance of users”. The agency is recommending Congress pass federal privacy regulations based on what it has documented. In particular, the agency is urging lawmakers to recognize that the business models of many of these companies do little to incentivize effective self-regulation or protection of user data. “Recognizing this basic fact is important for enforcers and policymakers alike because any efforts to limit or regulate how these firms harvest troves of people’s personal data will conflict with their primary business incentives,” FTC chair Lina Khan said in a statement. “To craft effective rules or remedies limiting this data collection, policymakers will need to ensure that violating the law is not more lucrative than abiding by it.”\n\nThe FTC is also asking that the companies mentioned in the report invest in “limiting data retention and sharing, restricting targeted advertising, and strengthening protections for teens”.",

The independent directors of the genetic testing firm said in a letter posted Tuesday that they were quitting the company’s board after not receiving a satisfactory buyout offer from the CEO, Anne Wojcicki. “After months of work, we have yet to receive from you a fully financed, fully diligenced, actionable proposal that is in the best interests of the non-affiliated shareholders,” said the seven directors, including the CEO of YouTube, in a letter to the company’s co-founder and CEO. In a memo to employees reported by the Wall Street Journal, Wojcicki responded: “I am surprised and disappointed by the decision of the directors to resign.” She maintained that taking the company private was still its best strategic option and said she would conduct a search for new board members. Wojcicki, who has been trying to take the company private since April, had proposed to acquire all outstanding shares of 23andMe not owned by her or her affiliates for $0.40 a share in July. She controls 49% of voting shares in the company. A special committee formed by the company rejected the proposal, deeming it insufficient and not in the best interest of the non-affiliated shareholders.

The FBI confirmed on 12 August that it was investigating a complaint from Donald Trump’s presidential campaign that Iran had hacked and distributed a trove of sensitive campaign documents. On 19 August intelligence officials confirmed that Iran was behind the hack. There’s no indication that any of the recipients in Biden’s campaign team responded, officials said on Wednesday, and several media organisations approached over the summer with leaked stolen information have also said they did not respond. Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign called the emails from Iran “unwelcome and unacceptable malicious activity” that were received by only a few people who regarded them as spam or phishing attempts. The emails were received before the hack of the Trump campaign was publicly acknowledged, and there’s no evidence the recipients of the emails knew their origin. The announcement is the latest US government effort to call out what officials say is Iran’s brazen, ongoing work to interfere in the election, including a hack-and-leak campaign that the FBI and other federal agencies linked last month to Tehran. Iran has denied interfering in US affairs. On Wednesday its permanent mission to the United Nations in New York said the latest allegations were “fundamentally unfounded, and wholly inadmissible.”\n\nUS officials in recent months have used criminal charges, sanctions and public advisories to detail actions taken by foreign adversaries to influence the election, including an indictment targeting a covert Russian effort to spread pro-Russia content to US audiences.",

Security companies in Sweden reported a rise in sabotage attempts, including using drones over defence company facilities to document and map them, “more aggressive” espionage, cyber-attacks and misinformation. Europe has seen a series of incidents believed to involve Russia in recent months, including a foiled plot to assassinate the chief executive of a German arms manufacturer and a fire at a metal factory owned by a defence manufacturer in Berlin. The Swedish security service (Säpo) said there was an “increased Russian propensity for risk”, including in carrying out influence operations and sabotage. “We have for a period seen indications of an increased Russian propensity for risk, and this applies to security-threatening activities. This is broad, everything from influence operations to even sabotage, which is aimed at the west and thus at Sweden,” Karl Melin, a spokesperson for Säpo, told the broadcaster SVT. As a result of Sweden’s support for Ukraine, Säpo regards military facilities and arms factories as most vulnerable. “We have raised the illegal intelligence activities of foreign powers for many years, but it is now that we see this difference and possibly a tendency towards increased Russian risk-taking. It is a change we take very seriously and which we act on to meet that threat,” Melin said. The Swedish security and defence industry association (SOFF), which represents 250 companies, said they were seeing “more aggressive intelligence operations to gather sensitive information through espionage.",

        "text": "Russia is putting generative artificial intelligence to work in online deception campaigns, but its efforts have been unsuccessful, according to a Meta security report released on Thursday. The parent company of Facebook and Instagram found that so far AI-powered tactics “provide only incremental productivity and content-generation gains” for bad actors and Meta has been able to disrupt deceptive influence operations. Meta’s efforts to combat “coordinated inauthentic behavior” on its platforms come as fears mount that generative AI will be used to trick or confuse people in elections in the United States and other countries. Russia remains the top source of “coordinated inauthentic behavior” using bogus Facebook and Instagram accounts, David Agranovich, Meta’s security policy director, told reporters. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, those efforts have been concentrated on undermining Ukraine and its allies, according to the report. As the US election approaches, Meta expects Russia-backed online deception campaigns to attack political candidates who support Ukraine. Facebook has been accused for years of being used as a powerful platform for election disinformation. Russian operatives used Facebook and other US-based social media to stir political tensions in multiple US elections, including the 2016 election won by Donald Trump. Experts fear an unprecedented deluge of disinformation from bad actors on social networks because of the ease of using generative AI tools such as ChatGPT or the Dall-E image generator to make on demand content in seconds. AI has been used to create images and videos, and to translate or generate text along with crafting fake news stories or summaries, according to the report. When Meta scouts for deception, it looks at how accounts act rather than the content they post.",

        "text": "Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign has confirmed it was warned by the FBI it had been targeted by a foreign influence campaign, triggering renewed fears over foreign interference in US elections. The disclosure – reported by NBC – came after Donald Trump’s campaign claimed it had been hacked in an email phishing attempt, suspected to have been carried out by Iran. The FBI has confirmed in a statement it is investigating foreign hacking attempts against the campaigns. Harris’s campaign insisted on Tuesday its cybersecurity measures had prevented its systems from being hacked. “We have robust cybersecurity measures in place, and are not aware of any security breaches of our systems resulting from those efforts,” the campaign told NBC. But the confirmation of the FBI’s warning evoked memories of the 2016 campaign, when Russia was widely believed to have hacked the Democratic party’s email system in an effort to destabilise Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid and help Trump. The Russian hacking effort involved files being given to WikiLeaks, which subsequently published them. This time, the bureau said it was investigating efforts to hack the Biden-Harris campaign in the period before Joe Biden withdrew from the presidential race – effectively handing the Democratic nomination to Harris, the vice-president – as well as that of Trump, according to the Washington Post. Three Biden-Harris campaign staff members received spear phishing emails designed to look legitimate in order to give an intruder access to wider email communications, the Post reported. It is unclear whether the phishing attempt was successful, and the response by the now-renamed Harris campaign suggested that the vice-president’s staff were confident the campaign had not been hacked.",

OpenAI recently announced it had crossed 200 million weekly active users – nothing to be sniffed at, but it got its first 100 million within two months of release. A recent YouGov study found that the inclusion of AI in a product is as likely to turn off a potential purchaser as much as it is to get them to hand over their cash. Nevertheless, money keeps flowing into the sector, and advances keep coming. OpenAI is casting around investors for money to fund future development that would see the company valued at $150 billion. That would put it on a par with Cisco, Shell and McDonalds. And last week, it unveiled its latest model, called o1, which it has touted as a step change in the development of generative AI. The o1 model, previously codenamed Strawberry, is designed to reason through decisions, much in the same way humans do. The latest version of the model underpinning ChatGPT is actually a step backwards when it comes to speed of output and the size of the model, which is smaller for the time being. Think of it as GPT-4.5, rather than the rumoured next big iteration, GPT-5, which is reportedly still in development. Mission: Impossible? While on paper o1 is a damp squib, it does something that Alex had previously highlighted in this newsletter as an issue with LLM-based chatbots, and which he called the “Tom Cruise problem”.",

Clicking on the link to the broadcast, hosted by Trump’s dormant @RealDonaldTrump account, froze the site and rendered it unusable. Tweeters said they couldn’t dial in; some said their browsers had crashed. Musk, who owns X, wrote: “There appears to be a massive DDOS attack on X. Working on shutting it down.” The rest of X appeared to be functioning normally. The interview was due to begin at 8pm eastern US Time; Musk said he would work through the technical difficulties to start half an hour later. The issues seemed to resolve in the interim, and clicking the link allowed users to join the broadcast. When X’s hold music finally stopped at 8.30ET, a rustling was heard from Trump’s microphone. Then silence overtook the live stream for another 10 minutes. Both the former president and Musk were muted. The interview started shortly after, with X eventually displaying more than 1 million concurrent listeners. Musk said: “The attack saturated all of our data lines. We think we’ve overcome most of that. As this massive attack illustrates, there’s a lot of opposition to people just hearing what President Trump has to say.”\n\nTrump said he was happy with the mishap. “You broke every record in the book with so many millions of people.",

The Plucky Squire takes things one step further, and then things get very meta. About two-thirds of this game takes place in a gorgeous children’s picture book with a hand-illustrated feel, wherein the player helps the titular Squire and his two friends – an apprentice witch with an affinity for painting, and a mountainside rock’n’roll troll with a knack for rhythm – face up against the chaos raining down from the evil Humgrump. But despite these twee beginnings, it gets pretty postmodern pretty quickly. The remaining third of the gameplay takes place on the child’s desk around the book. The Squire has the power to jump out of the 2D world of his story into reality. Here he can turn pages, tilt the book itself and smuggle objects from the chaotic, messy desk into the story to help him. It’s hard to tell whether this wants to be a game for children, or for adults who are kids at heart. At first the game is a little slow, the tone sweet and simple as we meander through the bucolic early pages of the picture book. Then, the second we become capable of leaping out of the book, the difficulty ramps up quite quickly. There is a particularly tricky stealth section involving menacing beetles that feels at odds with the bright and silly interior of the world in the book.",

It’s called Avianos, and it’s part of an anthology of 50 games made in the 1980s by a little-known but influential developer, UFO Soft. One minor detail: UFO Soft is fictional. All the games in this collection were made by a small group of modern developers. This anthology, UFO 50 (out today), is at once a tribute to imaginary 1980s game history and real 1980s game history. It impeccably imitates the look, feel and experimental creativity of the era, without the technical limitations. These games aren’t mini-games – they’re substantial. I’ve played one Metroid-styled space adventure for over an hour and I don’t think I’m anywhere near completing it. I did complete the dinosaur war game, and it took a whole morning. I’m stuck currently midway through a game about guiding a little chameleon through predator-ridden levels. Many are multiplayer; there’s sports, strategy, side-scrolling shooters, puzzlers, and an infuriatingly difficult early GTA-style Crazy Taxi top-down racer about delivering onions. They are inspired by 1980s game history, but not limited by it: there are genres here that didn’t exist back then, and none of them goes quite so far as to simulate loading a game from a floppy disc – though the first game in the collection, Barbuta (1982), does charmingly make that telltale buzzing sound every time you enter a new screen. The sheer devotion to the bit here is astounding.",

Everyone who bought it on PlayStation 5 and PC was refunded, and the future of the game is now unclear. This is a brutal sequence of events. Sony bought the makers of Concord, Firewalk Studios, in 2023. Concord had been in development for eight years, and it was an expensive game, with bespoke cinematics and a long-term plan that would have cost $100m or more to develop. In its two weeks on the market, it sold fewer than 25,000 copies, according to estimates. This is a shocker, even compared with the year’s other bad news for developers and studios. Much has been written about why Concord flopped so spectacularly. As Keith Stuart pointed out in his review of the game, it launched into a crowded genre, the hero shooter, in which many players already have their preferred game (Overwatch, Valorant or Apex Legends, to name three). Sony’s marketing of the game also seemed to fail, in that almost nobody knew about Concord before it arrived. (I barely knew about it, and it’s my job to know these things.) Criticisms, too, were levelled at its characters and design: it was generic and didn’t have any particularly interesting gameplay ideas. The failure of Concord is also symbolic of the existential-level problems in modern game development: they are so expensive to create, and they take so long that a game can miss its moment years before it is released.",

The day before, a supreme court justice, Alexandre de Moraes, had done something hitherto unthinkable: ordered the country’s ISPs to block access to the platform, threatened a daily fine of 50,000 Brazilian reais (just under £6,800) for users who bypassed the ban by using virtual private networks (VPNs) and froze the finances of Elon Musk’s Starlink internet service provider in the country. The order would remain in force until the platform complied with the decisions of the supreme federal court, paid fines totalling 18.3m reais (nearly £2.5m) and appointed a representative in Brazil, a legal requirement for foreign companies operating there. Moraes had also instructed Apple and Google to remove the X app and VPN software from their stores, but later reversed that decision, citing concerns about potential “unnecessary” disruptions. Cue shock, horror, incredulity, outrage and all the reactions in between. Musk – who has been sparring with Moraes for quite a while – tweeted: “Free speech is the bedrock of democracy and an unelected pseudo-judge in Brazil is destroying it for political purposes.” The animosity between the two goes back to 8 January 2023, after the defeat of Jair Bolsonaro in the 2022 Brazilian presidential election, when a mob of his supporters attacked federal government buildings in the capital, Brasília. The mob invaded and caused deliberate damage to the supreme federal court, the national congress and the Planalto presidential palace in an abortive attempt to overthrow the democratically elected president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.",

If we say it is 40 books, what are they?” He was using the term “canon” in the sense of “the collection of works considered representative of a period or genre”, but astutely qualifying it to stop Harold Bloom – the great literary critic who spent his life campaigning for a canon consisting of the great works of the past (Shakespeare, Proust, Dante, Montaigne et al) – spinning in his grave. Greer’s challenge was immediately taken up by Patrick Collison, co-founder with his brother, John, of the fintech giant Stripe (market value $65bn) and thus among the richest Irishmen in history. Unusually among tech titans, Collison is a passionate advocate of reading, and so it was perhaps predictable that he would produce a list of 43 books – adding a caveat that it wasn’t “the list of books that I think one ought to read – it’s just the list that I think roughly covers the major ideas that are influential here”. (“Here” being Silicon Valley.) The list included some predictable choices: Isaac Asimov’s Foundation; Richard Dawkins’s The Selfish Gene; Ayn Rand’s Atlas Shrugged; Stewart Brand’s Whole Earth Catalog; Nick Bostrom’s Superintelligence; Richard Rhodes’s The Making of the Atomic Bomb; Eric Raymond’s The Cathedral and the Bazaar; Christopher Alexander’s A Pattern Language; Fred Brooks’s The Mythical Man-Month and Robert Pirsig’s Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.",

Musk is now locked in a fierce public battle with the government and judicial system of Brazil, in the name of free speech, after he refused a court order to block several accounts that were accused of spreading hate speech and disinformation. He is a key figure in the US election race, having been lined up for a job finding savings in government spending should Donald Trump – who he has endorsed – win the presidency. Thanks to his Starlink satellites, he is a critical figure in the balance of power between Russia and Ukraine. Musk is a powerful man because of his wealth and his control of strategic industries, including space launch and satellites. But he is inescapable because of the social network he took over and then transformed: Twitter. Even people who never used Twitter more or less know its story over the last few years: Musk bought it, gave it a juvenile new name, X, and the whole thing seems to have been a complete mess that has made everyone miserable, including Musk himself.

The one person who is actually shown putting him to any sort of test is Richard Madeley, in a 2004 episode of the Richard and Judy Show; Madeley presents him with an apple painted blue and asks him to divine what colour it is, by putting his microphone close to the object, and listening to the resulting note. Harbisson passes with flying colours, although a more interesting and rigorous test would surely require him to do it blindfolded, to show that he’s not just a person with ordinary colour vision pranking us?\n\nLater, we discover that Harbisson is marketing various objects that supposedly allow people to extend their sensory perceptions and partake of the radical new cyborgism. One of these is “North Sense”, a device you place on your skin which vibrates when you face north.

Is that all it is? Elsewhere, one might be surprised to read: “The ancient Romans had a clear understanding of what democracy means.” No doubt the Romans would have been happy to hear that they would, 2,000 years in the future, be given a gold star for their comprehension of eternally stable political concepts by Yuval Noah Harari.

Disorientation causes them to think in apocalyptic terms.” It seems that, in the intervening years, Harari has himself become a liberal, because this book is about the apocalyptic scenario of how the “computer network” – everything from digital surveillance capitalism to social feed algorithms and AI – might destroy civilisation and usher in “the end of human history”. Take that, Fukuyama. Like Malcolm Gladwell, Harari has a passionate need to be seen to overturn received wisdom. Many people think, for example, that the printing press made a crucial contribution to the emergence of modern science. Not so, insists Harari: after all, printing equally enabled the dissemination of fake news, such as books about witches, and so Gutenberg is partly to blame for the gruesome torture and murder of those accused of witchcraft across Europe.",

Onboard, troops from the national environmental agency, Ibama, and the federal highway police found tools typical of this illegal industry: three bottles of mercury, 10g of gold and an enormous drill bit used to pulp the riverbed below. But a more modern contraption also caught their eye: a sleek white receiver made by Elon Musk’s satellite internet firm Starlink, which is at the centre of an intensifying showdown between Brazilian authorities and the US billionaire that last week resulted in his social network X being blocked in South America’s biggest country. “It’s a satellite internet antenna that provides communications to this whole criminal network,” said a special forces combatant as he showed off the device his unit had seized – one of scores taken from such criminals this year. “We find it everywhere now. Every mining dredge has at least one of them,” the police officer added of the antenna that was being used to connect the barge and its security cameras with an absentee owner in a city hundreds of miles away. As recently as two years ago, few in the backlands of the Amazon – where high-speed internet has long been an unthinkable luxury – had heard of Starlink or SpaceX, the rocket company that is Starlink’s parent and has sent more than 6,000 low-orbit satellites into space to beam down signals to secluded spots such as this.",

But some people need something on the extreme side and that's precisely what the Plank Firm was designed for. This mattress takes it even higher with a flippable side that offers even more firmness. Based on the name Plank Firm, you would expect this mattress to be pretty firm as it gets, and you would be correct. I have tested around 300 different mattresses in a six-year span, and this is in the top five firmest beds I have tested. This means that the Plank Firm mattress isn't for most sleepers out there, but for those of you out there who love firm mattresses, or better yet, need it, this bed has a lot to offer. First impressions of the Plank Firm mattress\n\nUsually, when unboxing a mattress made with entirely foam layers, like Plank, there is a 24- to 48-hour period where the foams will properly firm up, and you can really begin to get an idea of the firmness profile of the bed but with Plank it was immediately firm right out of the box. Like most beds it did have a bit of an odor to it, but that also usually dissipates in 24 hours. It also took the team a minute to figure out that Plank is a flippable mattress. Other flippable beds like Layla and the Brentwood Home Crystal Cove make the fact that it's flippable very apparent with tags and the design of the cover, but not as much on Plank, mostly because the logo looked very strange upside down.",

The game is slated to be released sometime in 2025 exclusively on Netflix Games, and you can sign up to join the beta now. Super Evil Megacorp, the team behind the award-winning game Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate, developed this co-op action game you can play with friends or on your own. Netflix said in a news conference that Super Evil Megacorp worked with Snyder and his production company, The Stone Quarry, to develop the game. \"Megacorp was granted full access to reference materials and information about the lore of the larger Rebel Moon universe,\" Matthew Denomme, a Netflix Games producer, said in the news conference. \"They've also been given the blessing to develop an original story for the game that, while standalone and not requiring you to have seen the films, fits into the canon.\" The game takes place on the planet Krypt, where you start a small rebellion against the ruthless Motherworld. As you progress through the game, you bring more of the planet into the fight. The game is set in the Rebel Moon universe and draws on the lore of the film series, but many of the characters in the game are only mentioned in passing -- if at all -- in the film series. For fans of the films, there is a playable Jimmy -- a sentient machine from the films -- in the game. There are four different classes of characters you and your friends can play as.",

As part of the Digital Markets Act that came into force last year, EU regulators have given Apple compliance instructions on how to expand interoperability between iPhones and devices made by other companies, like smartwatches, headphones, virtual reality headsets and more. This includes features like device pairing, notifications and connectivity, the commission specified. The tech giant must pave the way for these devices to work with iOS and iPadOS at no cost to developers, as well as offer help when requested. The European Commission will work with Apple on compliance for these interoperability requirements through a pair of official proceedings that will wrap up next year. \"We are focused on ensuring fair and open digital markets. Effective interoperability, for example, with smartphones and their operating systems, plays an important role in this,\" Margrethe Vestager, executive vice president in charge of competition policy at the European Commission, wrote in an official post. Apple confirmed in a statement that it will keep working with the Commission to protect users and clarify the regulation. The tech giant has created ways for apps in the European Union to request more interoperability with iOS and iPadOS \"while protecting our users.

The bombastic commissioner, with his swoop of white hair, became the public face of Brussels’ irritation with American tech giants, touring Silicon Valley last summer to personally remind the industry of looming regulatory deadlines. Combative and outspoken, Breton warned that Apple had spent too long “squeezing” other companies out of the market. In a case against TikTok, he emphasized, “our children are not guinea pigs for social media.”\n\nHis confrontational attitude to the CEOs themselves was visible in his posts on X. In the lead-up to Musk’s interview with Donald Trump, Breton posted a vague but threatening letter on his account reminding Musk there would be consequences if he used his platform to amplify “harmful content.” Last year, he published a photo with Mark Zuckerberg, declaring a new EU motto of “move fast to fix things”—a jibe at the notorious early Facebook slogan. And in a 2023 meeting with Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Breton reportedly got him to agree to an “AI pact” on the spot, before tweeting the agreement, making it difficult for Pichai to back out. Yet in this week’s reshuffle of top EU jobs, Breton resigned—a decision he alleged was due to backroom dealing between EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and French president Emmanuel Macron. “I'm sure [the tech giants are] happy Mr. Breton will go, because he understood you have to hit shareholders’ pockets when it comes to fines,” says Umberto Gambini, a former adviser at the EU Parliament and now a partner at consultancy Forward Global.",

Nintendo and The Pokémon Company announced Thursday that they’ve filed a patent infringement lawsuit in Tokyo against Pocketpair, the company behind the game, claiming Palworld “infringes multiple patent rights.”\n\nThe lawsuit isn’t completely unexpected. In Palworld, players catch creatures by weakening them and trapping them in Pal Spheres, similar to Poké Balls. Fans have also pointed out numerous similarities in design between Pals and Pokémon. Players have also drawn Nintendo’s ire for creating mods that make the connection explicit by including actual Pokémon. Curiously, though, Nintendo’s statement alleges patent violations, not copyright ones, which may indicate the suit could be more about game mechanics than creature design. Palworld, released in January, was an instant success. Within its first month, the open world survival game sold more than 12 million copies and became Microsoft’s biggest third-party Game Pass launch ever. On Thursday, as news of the lawsuit spread, Pocketpair released a statement saying the company was “unaware of the specific patents [it is] accused of infringing upon,” but vowing to investigate the claims. The company says it will continue to work on improving the game; it released a patch with bug fixes earlier this week. “It is truly unfortunate that we will be forced to allocate significant time to matters unrelated to game development due to this lawsuit,” the statement reads. “However, we will do our utmost for our fans, and to ensure that indie game developers are not hindered or discouraged from pursuing their creative ideas.”\n\nOnline, fans continue to vocally support the game.",

Science journals collect unusual cases, like Oliver Sacks’ account of waking to find his nurse had “become inorganic” and was drifting apart like a set of mosaic tiles. In rare cases, an individual can feel they are suddenly growing to an enormous size or shrinking entirely out of view—known as Alice in Wonderland Syndrome. For most, these auras appear as if from nowhere, most commonly as a set of scintillating zigzags that grow for about 20 minutes across the edge of the field of vision. Intriguing in themselves, these phenomena are dire omens. They forewarn of the arrival, in less than an hour, of the sustained pain of a migraine. Migraines are the world’s third most prevalent cause of disability, affecting a billion people each year by some estimates. About a third experience some form of aura beforehand, often accompanied by debilitating symptoms from vomiting to vertigo, or, in worse cases, temporary blindness or hemiplegia, a paralysis down one side of the body. But recent discoveries about mechanisms that link auras and migraines could lead to potential new treatments. Martin Kaag Rasmussen, a neuroscientist at the University of Copenhagen, says research on auras may reveal new answers to the greatest riddle of migraines: How do painful headaches arise from the brain if it has no pain receptors? The brain, like other internal organs, is insensate, its lack of sensory receptors attested by videos of virtuoso violinists who play on unfazed as neurosurgeons go to work inside their skulls.",

The psychological effect—which he believes was intentional—was long-lasting. Even years later, after he'd left Lebanon, the sound of fireworks would make him start subconsciously sweating and shaking. This week, the booms rippling across Lebanon came not from Israeli jets streaking across the sky, but from electronic devices exploding in people's pockets and hands. Yet Kobeissi, now a security researcher based in Paris, says the lingering fear following the attack is familiar: When he speaks to his family members who are still in Lebanon, they tell him that their iPhones have been heating up, and ask whether they're right to be worried. “They're wondering, is my phone being hacked? Is it going to blow up?” Kobeissi says. “It's worse than the sonic booms, because it's completely novel, and it's almost impossible to explain to them.”\n\nOn Tuesday and Wednesday, explosives hidden in thousands of pagers—and later walkie-talkies and other electronic devices—detonated across Lebanon in an apparent attack targeting the membership of the militant group Hezbollah. The unprecedented, stunning operation, which has been widely attributed to Israel despite no claim of responsibility by any Israeli government agency, killed at least 32 people, including at least four children and several hospitals workers, and injured more than 3,300 others, according to the country's health ministry.",

Before you go any further, back up your iPhone. Remember to use the backup function in specific apps (like WhatsApp) and to transfer codes from apps like Google Authenticator. Next, it’s a good idea to unpair your Apple Watch if you have one. You can do this in the Watch app on your iPhone by going to the My Watch tab.",

All they saw was something that enraged them. Katie Notopoulos: Right. And the idea that there's people out there on the internet who have totally terrible opinions and are stupid and rude, that's 100 percent true. Michael Calore: No, no. Katie Notopoulos: There's no reason for anyone to not know that if you see someone acting like a jerk online, why would you ever think that's not real? We know that's real. And people on Instagram may see this, too, whether or not they have signed up for Threads. But you see, occasionally, a little carousel of posts from other people you follow. So, if you follow a celebrity who's also posting on Threads or something like that, you'll start to see a little carousel of their Threads posts when you're scrolling through Instagram. So, I think a lot of people ended up coming to it that way too. So, they might even barely have been Threads users. I did notice that I think this is a good indicator of how much these people were actively using Threads. A lot of them didn't have profile pictures.

Well, until recently. Newly 18, Barron Trump is now a freshman at NYU and a burgeoning political adviser to his father. For the past two weeks, my TikTok For You page has been filled with posts from New York University students posting clips of Barron Trump attending classes as if he were Sasquatch: the videos are all blurry and taken hurriedly, and mostly feature fellow students trying to track down the once-elusive Trump. These cryptic videos, complete with shaky camera angles set to songs like Chamillionaire’s “Ridin,’” are all over, taken from “day in my life”-style student videos and reposted to the dozens of Barron stan accounts across TikTok and Instagram. These posts have garnered millions of views and look like paparazzi shots. You can tell from the camera angle that the people filming are trying to hide their cameras under backpacks or sweaters.

A voice says: “You can take your blindfold off now.” I squint as I get my bearings. Then, after a bit more hiking and some bushwhacking, I finally see it. The prize. The thing no one is supposed to know the location of, at least for another few weeks. A golden treasure. I have to fight a lizard-brain instinct to reach for it. No. If all goes to plan, the treasure will soon belong to someone else—to the winner of a wild treasure hunt dreamed up by two of the guys leading me through this remote wilderness. One is a musician named Tom Bailey. The other is Jason Rohrer, the mastermind. Rohrer has designed some of the brainiest, highest-concept video games of the 21st century. Now there’s this: not a video game, but Rohrer’s first game set in the real world. This is the real Project Skydrop trophy. This is not its real location.

The strike began on July 12 but escalated in August. Initially, says Giorgi Diasamidze, head of the employee union LABOR, the company threatened that a strike would cause it to pull out of the country entirely. (The company cut 1,000 jobs after the strike was announced.) But when striking workers escalated their protest by attempting to block the entrance to the building in mid-August, Diasamidze and employees who spoke to WIRED allege that non-uniformed private security people hired by the company beat the strikers. “They are hiding their identities. They did not care about gender. [I know people] who have bruises, who are struggling to walk,“ says Diasamidze. Pictures and video shared with WIRED show apparent bruising and welts from the guards’ aggressive behavior toward workers, and a guard violently yanking a worker off a bench. A handful of workers, including Mahare Patashuri, went on a hunger strike. “I can’t believe I am still alive,” Patashuri told WIRED in August. Last week, Patashuri was taken to the hospital after 28 days without food. Evolution spokesperson Carl Linton said in a written statement that the company \"has, and will continue to, work towards a resolution of the dispute within the established process and local law. Evolution firmly supports and respects the workers right to strike within the local legal framework.\" \"The union's decision to illegally block the entrances for working employees, violating their right according to Georgian law,\" he continued.",

The answer largely depends on how much you make and where you live, according to the nonprofit Pew Research Center, which has studied the size of the middle class for over a decade. According to the center's latest report, 52% of Americans were part of the middle class in 2022, marking a slight increase from 50% in 2015. However, this is still significantly lower than the 61% who were members of the middle class in 1971. The report found that lower-income households make up 28% of the population, while 19% of Americans were in the upper-income tier. To see how you stack up, use Pew’s updated calculator, which just asks you to enter your location, income and household size. You can also see how you compare to other people who share your demographic characteristics. If you plug in your education, age, marital status and race or ethnicity, the calculator tool will show the share of Americans with matching details who are in the middle class. Are you a member of the middle class? The “middle class” can be a somewhat abstract term. While definitions vary, the general concept is closely related to the idea of the “American dream,” or the promise that if you work hard at a typical job and manage your money, you should be able to buy a home, raise a family and ultimately enjoy a comfortable retirement. Pew’s analysis qualifies someone as middle class if their income is between two-thirds to double the median household income.",

Launched in 1924 as a radio exhibition, IFA has transformed over a century into a stunning display of cutting-edge technology that shares a special bond with Samsung Electronics. Home appliances and electronics have followed this evolution. What were once large, bulky machines have since become highly advanced, integrated devices and essential companions in daily life. In the midst of this change, Samsung has positioned itself to lead the next 100 years of innovation by seamlessly connecting mobile devices, TVs and home appliances through SmartThings1 — while offering enhanced control over devices through upgrades in Bixby,2 the company’s voice assistant which can now better understand complex commands based on natural language. IFA 2024 kicks off on September 6 under the slogan “Innovation for All.” Before its grand opening, Samsung Newsroom looked back at IFA’s century-long journey of innovation and Samsung’s legacy of technological breakthroughs. From Radio Exhibition to Innovation Hub for AI Devices\n\nIn its early days, IFA served as a platform for the German government to showcase emerging radio technology in the 1920s. Albert Einstein even delivered the opening speech in 1930. This marked the beginning of a series of breakthroughs including the introduction of the world’s first car radio in 1932 and the first color TV in 1937. World War II halted IFA for several years in the 1940s, but technological progress continued. In 1971, the show was renamed Internationale Funkausstellung to become the IFA consumers know today. The evolution of home appliances has been equally remarkable.",

They’re tools that help you get things done, not something you want to invest a lot of time or money in. If that’s you — and there’s no judgment here from a certifiable gadget nerd — then you can probably think of more worthwhile ways to spend $1,000 than on a phone. Budget phones to the rescue.

You won’t get all the bells and whistles, but you will save a little money to spend on, I don’t know, actual bells and whistles. It’s your world. What I’m looking for Strong software support At least a couple of years of OS upgrades and, ideally, three years of security updates. There’s no point in buying even a cheap phone if you have to replace it after just a couple of years because it stopped getting security patches. A good screen Since you look at it roughly two thousand times a day, your phone’s screen is one place you shouldn’t compromise. An OLED has richer contrast and color than an LCD, and the big screens on today’s phones really need at least a 1080p resolution. Faster refresh rates like 90Hz and even 120Hz are becoming more common on budget phone screens, but for my money, a smooth-scrolling LCD doesn’t look as nice as an OLED with a standard refresh rate.",

Hundreds of articles have been talking about non-monogamy and polyamory. Some are calling it a fad , others are pointing out that it’s always been around . Trainwreck TV show Couple to Throuple presented an absolute masterclass in how not to do it, while other shows such as BBC mini-series Trigonometry got closer to good representation. And now, your Sims can be poly too. The Lovestruck Expansion pack for Sims 4 includes new WooHoo (aka sex) spots, new interactions including a new kiss and dance, and most interestingly of all, new ways to adjust your Sims' boundaries and allow for multiple relationships. As a polyamorous person myself (I’m in a throuple , a three-person relationship) I’m all for greater representation of different relationship structures. Polyamory being more widely talked about is, on the whole, a good thing. My partners and I certainly encounter fewer shocked responses now than we did when we first formed our throuple four years ago. More people have heard of polyamory and, for polyamorous folks, that’s a positive step towards acceptance.

Over 43,500 civilians were killed.\n\nIn Blitz, nine-year-old George (Elliott Heffernan) is sent by his mother Rita (Saoirse Ronan) to the countryside for safety, but George decides to return to her by himself — and a dangerous journey it is. The cast is stacked on this one, with Paul Weller, Harris Dickinson, Benjamin Clementine, Kathy Burke, Weller, Stephen Graham, Leigh Gill, Mica Ricketts, CJ Beckford, Alex Jennings, Joshua McGuire, Hayley Squires, Erin Kellyman and Sally Messham.\n\nBlitz sees McQueen reunite with many of his collaborators including 12 Years a Slave production designer Adam Stockhausen and composer Hans Zimmer, and Small Axe costume designer Jacqueline Durran.

Some, like new King Ar-Pharazôn (Trystan Gravelle) and his slimy son Kemen (Leon Wadham), are failing spectacularly, even going so far as to desecrate the oldest Valar shrine in Númenor. A small few, like former Queen Tar-Míriel (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) and former Sea Guard captain Elendil (Lloyd Owen), hold strong to their beliefs. That steadfastness has landed them in hot water, with Elendil in prison and poised to be executed. However, in episode 6, Pharazôn and his crony Lord Belzagar (Will Keen) decide that Elendil can undergo \"trial by abyss,\" as is customary for the ways of the Valar. The sea trial is still as good as a death sentence. After all, the process involves forcing the accused into the ocean to face off against a massive sea worm. There's likely no coming back from that, and Elendil knows it. If he dies, Pharazôn reaps not only the reward of wiping one of his detractors off the board, but also gets to further discredit the Valar by saying they abandon their followers in their time of need. What Pharazôn couldn't predict was that Míriel would volunteer herself in Elendil's place. It's a massive moment for Míriel, an attempt to take back some control after being at her lowest point all season long. \"There was definitely an excitement of getting to put her in a position where there was going to be that show of strength,\" Addai-Robinson told Mashable.",

The interacting galaxies, called Arp 107, collided hundreds of millions of years ago, and a bridge of stars has formed between them as they undergo the long, gradual process of merging into one. Our Milky Way, too, has merged before, and may, in the distant future, meld with an even larger galaxy. Here's what you're seeing in Webb's new image, which shows an event transpiring 450 million light-years way:\n\n- Older stars and the bridge: The white areas are older stars, which you can see plenty of in both the galaxies. These stars also make up the \"tenuous bridge of gas and stars that runs between [the galaxies],\" the European Space Agency (ESA) explained. - Vibrant star formation: When galaxies collide with one another, their gasses meet and condense. The resulting weighty clouds of gas can collapse, driving the formation of new stars. In this image, Webb's Mid-Infrared Instrument reveals these expansive star-forming regions in orange and red. - Deep space galaxies: Nearly all those objects in the background are distant galaxies — many spirals like ours — each teeming with their own stars, and likely planets. The two colliding galaxies of the object Arp 107. Credit: NASA / ESA / CSA / STScI\n\nSpace is indeed vast, but galaxies collide because they harbor unimaginable amounts of gravity, and are attracted to each other. \"It's very likely that a galaxy will encounter a galaxy comparable or smaller over the course of its lifetime,\" Diego Muñoz, an astrophysicist at Northern Arizona University, recently told Mashable.",

But how does it fare when it comes to a little astrophotography? I grabbed Apple's most premium current-gen iPhone 16 and stacked it against the recently dropped Pixel 9 Pro XL (Google's best smartphone offering). The question is, which one is the most stellar at taking moon pictures? Let’s see if one truly outshines — or should I say, eclipses — the other in capturing one of the sky’s most breathtaking celestial bodies. iPhone 16 Pro Max vs. Google Pixel 9 Pro XL: moon capture\n\nMobile astrophotography experts recommend using a variety of gear to capture the moon at its best, including a tripod to stabilize the device, binocular lenses or a small telescope for a clearer view of the lunar surface, and even paid apps to fine-tune camera settings. However, I decided to go minimalist and use both the iPhone 16 Pro Max and Google Pixel 9 Pro XL — sans the recommended equipment — to capture photos of the moon.

Has Feeld, the dating app where you can toggle between Shibari enthusiasts , a polycule looking to add a fourth or fifth, and a Burner well-versed in Tantric sex, become the new dating app du jour? I joined Feeld in 2017, when it was a far smaller and more self-selecting community. As someone seeking casual sex with people who were comfortable talking about it, the app was a godsend. I told all my friends about it, but most recoiled as soon as I said \"kinky,\" so I'd accepted it as an \"if you know you know\" app; a place where, as Tinashe sings, I could find someone to match my freak . SEE ALSO: People are using AI to date you\n\nIn the past few years, the app's public profile has risen — from articles in The New Yorker and the New York Times to TikTokkers singing its praises. And since 2022, Feeld has seen an average user growth of 30 percent each year according to Fast Company , and confirmed by a spokesperson for the app. Today, in-between hearing my friends gush about Feeld and swiping past frat boy look-alikes claiming they're \"on here to see what it's all about hahah,\" it seems that Feeld has gone from niche to mainstream.

This creates a curved cosmic lens, bending and distorting light, while also magnifying and brightening the light. It's an invaluable natural telescope for astronomers, and researchers have recently discovered an extremely potent such lens (also called a \"gravitational lens\"). From our view on Earth, it's a rare alignment of galaxies. There's a foreground cluster of galaxies (the lens) located some 5 billion light-years away, and behind that, there's an impressive line of seven galaxies. \"This is an amazingly lucky ‘galactic line-up’ – a chance alignment of multiple galaxies across a line-of-sight spanning most of the observable universe,\" David Schlegel, an astrophysicist at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab who coauthored the research, said in a statement. \"Finding one such alignment is a needle in the haystack. Finding all of these is like 8 needles precisely lined up inside that haystack.\" The research recently published in the peer-reviewed journal The Astrophysical Journal. This unusual, warped cluster makes impossible deep space observations a reality. \"By virtue of its ability to drastically magnify background sources, strong lensing allows for significantly deeper and further observations than otherwise possible,\" the researchers wrote.

Deciding to invest in one of these powerful cybersecurity services is the easy part, but actually picking the right VPN for you and your tech is tricky. But do not fear, because we can help you make an informed decision. Here's everything you need to know before subscribing to a VPN. What is a VPN? A VPN provides vital protection for your data and identity when you're online by creating a private network that hides your real IP address. This network forms a protected tunnel that you send all of your information through, so instead of sending and receiving information in the open, everything happens under the cover of an encrypted connection. The result of this process is that nobody can see your data, and all of your activity is protected against online threats like viruses, hackers, and malware. Do you need a VPN for your iPad? We all know that iOS devices are generally more secure than devices operating with Android, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't invest in some form of cybersecurity for your most prized possessions. That's because every time you browse the web or connect to public WiFi, your data could be exposed to online threats. To keep your data protected in transit, you need a VPN. SEE ALSO: Tech worker wore an Apple Vision Pro at his wedding\n\nThe other reason to consider partnering your iPad with a VPN relates to streaming.

Unlike your 20s or 30s, you can't assume everyone your age is single and looking. While meeting people organically in public still happens, it can be easier to meet potential partners where they're actively seeking a romantic connection — on dating sites. There's a comfort in knowing that the people you find on dating apps are single and looking for a romantic relationship, so at least you're both on the same page from the start. What we're trying to say is that there is nothing to fear about dating again at 40. How do you start dating again at 40? The first step to start dating after a break is simply acknowledging that you're ready. From there, you can decide how and where you want to try to meet people. Dating apps have been around for decades, which means they are totally normal and shouldn't be a last resort. You'll also want to be direct with what you're hoping to achieve. A serious relationship? Casual hookup? Friendship that might lead to more? Whatever it is, be upfront because you don't want to fall for someone who isn't looking for the same thing. Honesty is always the best policy.

Agatha All Along feels like a witch's potion brewed specifically to make me giddy with joy. How could it not, when its ingredients include magical trials, rocking songs, and Patti LuPone herself? The MCU's latest TV series serves as a follow-up to 2021's WandaVision, focusing on Wanda Maximoff's (Elizabeth Olsen) nosey neighbor turned witchy nemesis Agatha Harkness (Kathryn Hahn), and taking its name from her Emmy-winning introductory theme song. Yet even though Agatha All Along finds itself in superhero sequel territory, the series and showrunner Jac Schaeffer (also the creator of WandaVision) forge their own path down the Witches' Road. Yes, you'll still find genre pastiche in the vein of its predecessor — although far less extreme — as well as witchy characters struggling to regain what's been taken from them. But Agatha All Along's focus on a coven of underdogs also invites new kooky characters into the MCU, whose chemistry with Agatha is the show's biggest superpower. What's Agatha All Along about? Kathryn Hahn in \"Agatha All Along.\" Credit: Chuck Zlotnick / Marvel\n\nAgatha All Along kicks off with a WandaVision-esque TV show spoof. This time, instead of Wanda taking the lead, it's Agatha. Sporting a scarf, a hardboiled detective attitude, and hints of a Delco accent, she's the spitting image of Kate Winslet in Mare of Easttown.

        "text": "Apple made history this month when a feature in the company's forthcoming AirPods Pro 2 was approved by the Food and Drug Administration as the first over-the-counter (OTC), clinical-grade hearing aid software. The Hearing Aid Feature, as Apple refers to the software, amplifies sound for adults with perceived mild to moderate hearing impairment (it also features a user-friendly hearing test). Stigma over hearing loss — and old-school hearing aids — persists, even though over 30 million Americans suffer from some level of hearing loss. Can the new AirPods convince more people to get their hearing tested, boost their aural faculties, and lead better lives? Attorney Haben Girma, the first deafblind person to graduate from Harvard Law School and the author of Haben: The Deafblind Woman Who Conquered Harvard Law, is optimistic about what the new AirPods — available this fall in many countries — can offer. Girma connected with Mashable about the AirPods' innovation and Big Tech's role in improving disabled lives. Mashable: As a disability advocate, are the hearing aid-assisted AirPods a game-changer? Haben Girma: The AirPods Pro 2 is a powerful new tool for people with hearing disabilities! The diversity within this community includes a variety of different types of hearing and life experiences. Extensive accessibility features throughout the Apple ecosystem means more people with combined hearing and other disabilities (visual disabilities, learning disabilities, mobility disabilities, and more) will have the ability to personally adjust their own hearing aids. Do you believe the Air Pods could help those with profound hearing loss, as opposed to only those experiencing age-related hearing loss? The goal is to give people choices.",

But in this case, Marshall is telling it like it is. The brand claims the Major IV headphones get 80+ hours of wireless battery life, and while we haven't tested that claim ourselves, Lead Shopping Reporter Bethany Allard put the newer Marshall Major V headphones (which claim to have 100 hours of battery life) through the wringer and got a whopping 106 hours and 48 minutes of playtime before the headphones ran out of juice. So we'll trust Marshall on this one. Allard was also impressed by the well-balanced sound profile that came from the Marshall headphones.

A WhatsApp exploit is allowing users access to View Once messages after they are supposed to be inaccessible. Credit: Silas Stein/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\nIf you're sending a \"View Once\" message, photo, or video through WhatsApp, don't be so sure that the receiver can't view it again. Security researchers with crypto wallet ZenGo recently discovered a bug that allowed WhatsApp users to view \"View Once\" messages as many times as they liked. In response, WhatsApp patched the issue. But, ZenGo researchers then discovered another exploit in WhatsApp's temporary fix that once again allowed them to access these messages that had supposedly disappeared. WhatsApp View Once exploit\n\nWhatsApp launched its View Once feature in 2021. View Once allows users to send texts, photos, and videos that disappear after the recipient initially accesses them. Furthermore, to ensure the ephemeral nature of these messages, WhatsApp disables screenshots from being used in the app on View Once messages through iOS and Android. In addition, WhatsApp limits View Once messages to the mobile apps only. However, in a post last week, ZenGo Security Research Manager Tal Be'ery detailed an exploit that allowed his team to access View Once messages over and over again. Basically, as Be'ery explains , the View Once messages are only restricted from view in the mobile apps after being viewed. The media continues to exist on WhatsApp's servers. If a user can find the URL for the media file, they can access the message or media file that was supposed to have disappeared.",
